I urge anyone who hasn't done so to read through the chapter on digital assets in the Economic Report of the President. It's gives a full picture of the deviousness and flippancy of the Biden administration towards crypto. Take this gem on pg 238 for example

> crypto assets to date do not appear to offer any investments with any fundamental value, nor do they act as an effective alternative to fiat money, improve financial inclusion or make payments more efficient; instead their innovation has been mostly about creating artificial scarcity in order to support crypto assets' prices - and many of them have no fundamental value

Complete horseshit. They **do** act as a non-inflationary alternative to debasement of fiat money, today. They *do* act as a self-custodial alternative to money which relies on trusting banks which are literally teetering, today. 

They *do* improve financial inclusion. A kid in rural India or Mexico or Romania can take part in the Ethereum defi ecosystem with just an internet connection, today. Trading securities and treasuries and holding American dollars is a privilege to a tiny fraction of the world, and it's sad to see the Biden ainistration not see this. 

They *do* make payments more efficient. This is increasingly clear for internet native payments. Buying and selling digital native art and culture, paying members of a DAO, transferring funds to colleagues in the same team but all over the world, making small payments in countries like Nigeria and Lebanon with collapsing local currencies - various crypto solutions *do* make payments efficient in these instances, today.  

And last and most importantly of all, is that *even if crypto had no usecase* (which isn't true as I pointed out above), even if, that value judgement is still not the business of the federal government. Here's a great take by Chervinsky 

> [Too many policymakers are playing venture capitalist, guessing which technologies will be valuable and which won't.Tech neutrality is a core principle of good policy for a reason. Picking winners and losers is hard enough for the professionals. Government should stay out of it.](https://twitter.com/jchervinsky/status/1638365111508246531)

If you're tired of this government lying, gaslighting and overreach, a good place to start is to sign up for the crypto advocacy program by Coinbase: <https://actnow.io/z31xN5P>

<summary>u/nixorokish, a real crypto native and OG fell victim to a phishing attempt and tells her story</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11slqjw/daily_general_discussion_march_16_2023/jcggo1x/)

dang. First time I've ever fallen for something stupid. I went to check out Arbitrum eligibility and clicked the first link under the announcement. The link did look like a scam to me but I had just read a friend comment that the legit airdrop announcement / video "looks like a scam", so my brain had its defenses down. Only connected and *I think* it just took whatever already had approvals? Which was all my DAI. feelsbadman.jpg - 5400 DAI is no small sum. It unfortunately looks like they got a few people before the tweet was hidden.

My brain finally went 'nope' when it asked to approve RPL, but everything before that was just a signature to connect (I think?), not a transaction or approval. 

Things I could have done better (that I usually would do!):

- Matched the twitter handle from the tweet to the actual account    
- Found the link elsewhere (verified it) before connecting my wallet, especially in their discord    
- Generally slow down and read when signing things from my wallet.     

Expensive lesson learned! I'm going to lay down and watch a movie or something, I'm super bummed that I'm a dummy.


Another thing learned in this (thanks to /u/Ribilla_ ) - DAI is a special kind of ERC20 that allows transfers that require only a signature (`permit`, which is a signature-based approval function) - it doesn't look like your typical approval or transaction. So even signatures when connecting to sites should be treated as potentially dangerous and giving away your assets.

<summary>u/bagogel12 and u/Unitedterror on the Euler exploit</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11tipbq/daily_general_discussion_march_17_2023/jck76nq/)

[u/bagogel12](https://reddit.com/u/bagogel12):

I can give a short update regarding the Euler exploiter situation. It's still a developing story ... if you missed episode 1 and 2, you find them here: [link](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11q1nrm/daily_general_discussion_march_13_2023/jc3gqo1/) / [link](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11slqjw/daily_general_discussion_march_16_2023/jceexxm/)

**S02E03 - The merciful hacker (cont.)**

After the exploiter sent 100 ETH to one affected user, DLNews identified this lucky person. DLnews is actually quite good - I didn't know Defillama has it's own newspaper! After [Swap.defillama.com/](https://Swap.defillama.com/) it's another killer product of the Llama universe ...

The interesting part of this episode is: The 100 ETH are actually worth more than what the user lost 78 wstETH (or 86 ETH). Essentially, the user would have profited from the "deal". Being now officially doxxed he sent back 12 ETH to the official Euler depositor address. Is this correct? Who knows, we'll see if Euler will push for the full amount to be returned. It's a subplot which runs through the entire season. ...

For more information on this incident, I refer directly to DLnews:

[https://www.dlnews.com/articles/regulation/euler-finance-hacker-eth-wallets-solidity-developer-exploit/](https://www.dlnews.com/articles/regulation/euler-finance-hacker-eth-wallets-solidity-developer-exploit/)

**S02E02 - The maniac hacker**

Every morning the hacker gets up, he's doing something with his freshly earnt money. If you own $200M you can have some fun with it, right?

So, Today morning, he decided to give 100 ETH to the allegedly North Korean and OFAC sanctioned Ronin Exploiter Address, probably Lazarus controlled. Here is the tx: [https://etherscan.io/tx/0x202a67d3a1d52e4dd5e1eebe49da511164b6e4a1ebe717dcf4674dd83a2bd457](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x202a67d3a1d52e4dd5e1eebe49da511164b6e4a1ebe717dcf4674dd83a2bd457)

Is he trying to fool us? Some kind of weird joke of 21 year old hacker? Or is it some kind of attribution to them? What will come next? Sending some to SBF or Alamada?

Or is he just bored and want his warrant level raised like in GTA?

Before he sent the 100 ETH to KimJongUn, he moved 1k ETH between his wallets but it's sitting there idle. At the moment, in total only 1.5k ETH has been sent to Tornando, the rest still in ETH (85k) or DAI (35 M).

**S02E03 - Tornado Cash Activity**

I did some tracking of the wallets which have used Tornado Cash recently. The activity has fallen quite a bit after it was hit with OFAC sanction rule. So it's kind of easy to track the activity even visually and manually. Here is the result:

[https://imgur.com/a/IbbO5db](https://imgur.com/a/IbbO5db)

I'm a bit surprised that 125ETH (and a batch of 100 ETH) went pretty straight from Tornado into Binance. The other larger chunks were moved into railgun and multiBTC, only some smaller amounts ran over "privacy oriented" exchanges.

It seems that the merciful-maniac hacker has not cashed their ETH out yet.

[u/Unitedterror](https://reddit.com/u/Unitedterror):

Okay Okay -- Heres the official Post-Mortem thread for the Euler hack: <https://twitter.com/TraversaJulian/status/1636782111616122881>

I reposted an earlier draft of it yesterday but I think the conversation here should really be around how safe people felt Euler was.

It was generally considered "as safe" as Compound, Aave, Maker, etc., and having a loss of ~$200m kind of breaks many previous assumptions about safety...

So my only conclusion is that we need to move towards more resilient mechanisms, mechanisms that cost significantly more to execute but are necessary to move forward effectively.

- Rate limiting
- Explicit / Limited Upgradability
- Built in diversification
- Circuitbreakers
- Isolated custodial modules

It really goes on, but these can only be effectively done if we all move towards L2's.

With the arb airdrop, now is the time to push for L2 adoption and the security that we really need to move DeFi forward.

<summary>u/Kukai_walker drafted a letter to their representative and shared the template for you. YES YOU</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11tipbq/daily_general_discussion_march_17_2023/jcm0fi7/)

At the encouragement of u/TheCryptosAndBloods [yesterday](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11slqjw/comment/jcfgbdu/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), I drafted a letter to my US representative, who happens to be among the 100+ member [Congressional Progressive Caucus](https://progressives.house.gov/home).  I took the perspective that crypto is well aligned with progressive principles so they should engage.  Including here for crowdsourcing feedback to improve it and/or for others to cut and paste from it especially if you too have a CPC representative:

=======================

Dear Representative xxx:
  
\[removed doxxable intro\]

I am writing to you today to **encourage you and CPC to engage actively in policymaking around digital assets (aka, crypto)**.

As one of the 20% of Americans who own digital assets, I have used much of my recent time to teach myself about digital assets and the broader domain of blockchain technology.  This is a highly technical field, requiring me to learn about such areas as cryptography, finance, decentralized networks, computing, and others.  This knowledge has yielded practical benefits in that I have learned how to join thousands of others to stake ether on the Ethereum blockchain which now provides me with a steady income.

This knowledge has also allowed me to cut through the hype, misinformation, and disinformation surrounding cryptocurrency in the popular discourse to conclude that in fact, **the crypto ecosystem of digital assets, smart contracts, and public blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum has value and will disrupt economic and business systems around the world.** For instance:

‚Ä¢ Decentralized financial protocols allow everyday people to instantly make payments around the world and make loans and other financial transactions without commercial middlemen

‚Ä¢ Immutable and transparent records on the public blockchain can protect intellectual property and assure fair and transparent management of royalties

‚Ä¢ Public blockchains can serve as a permanent store of critical personal events including birth, death, graduation, etc.

‚Ä¢ Assignment of unique non-fungible tokens can help manage ownership and transfer of collectibles, valuables, artwork, etc.

‚Ä¢ Blockchain has potential business uses such as on-line gaming, supply chain management or carbon credit system.

‚Ä¢ The crypto ecosystem can transform the internet business model from allowing dominant internet platforms (eg, Facebook, Google, Apple) to own and profit from personal information to a ‚Äúweb3‚Äù model where the user controls their own data on the blockchain.

I have also been struck by the fact that **there is significant alignment between the principles underlying cryptocurrency and the progressive agenda.**  The essence of the crypto ecosystem is that data and open-source computer code distributed and synchronized around the world can replace reliance on institutional middlemen (eg, banks, internet platforms) with a decentralized transparent system available to all whose trust comes from the decentralized crypto ecosystem in which users can directly take custody of their own assets and personal data.  These features can directly support the progressive agenda and its commitment to sweeping, transformative change:

‚Ä¢ Income inequality can be reduced by helping underserved populations‚Äîwho under legacy systems often cannot get a loan, buy a house, or start a business‚Äîto build wealth and carry out financial transactions without needed to rely on gatekeeping banks that may have institutional biases that disadvantage them.  

‚Ä¢ Facilitating crypto use can help advance racial justice and equity.  A 2019 FDIC survey found that 14% of African American households and 12% of Hispanic American households were unbanked compared to only 2.5% of white households.  A recent Harris Poll found that 30% of Black Americans and 27% of Hispanic Americans owned crypto compared to 17% of white Americans.

‚Ä¢ Replacing banks with self-custody and a fully transparent accounting on a public blockchain will reimagine the role of institutions that exacerbate injustice and inequality. 

**Congress must and will create a policy framework for digital assets in the US; it will be important to help shape this policy to promote progressive principles.** Now is the time to act.  Congress will likely see a number of bills introduced this session on such issues as rights to self-custody, defining digital asset taxonomy, and clarifying regulatory oversight.  Discussion on such legislation has already begun in the new Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Inclusion Subcommittee of the House Financial Services Committee which has recently expanded its scope to include cryptocurrency.  This Subcommittee includes two CPC members‚Äîrepresentatives Torres of NY and Sherman of CA.  The CPC can utilize its subcommittee membership and other opportunities to actively engage in shaping this legislation to reflect progressive priorities.

Moreover, **engaging on this issue provides a great opportunity for bipartisanship.** The need for regulation has bipartisan agreement. A number of Republican members have been actively supportive of addressing policy in this area (eg, representative Emmer of MN, Davidson of OH, and others).  It would be remarkable, yet natural, to join forces with the other party on this issue to demonstrate its importance to the American people.

In addition to legislation, **progressive congressional oversight is needed**. I have been dismayed at the administration‚Äôs actions that, in the context of overall banking system failures and under the guise of consumer protection, are inhibiting the development of a regulatory environment that would allow the digital asset sector to prosper.  There are those who believe that the administration is responding to entrenched interests that are threatened by the transformative change that crypto may catalyze, taking advantage of the current banking crises to squash crypto, such as by discouraging banks from holding crypto or servicing crypto clients.

I hope you and the CPC will take on this important issue to both support the progressive agenda as well as keep America‚Äôs leadership in this new sector.  Blockchain and crypto are borderless by nature.  If the US cannot provide a fertile environment for innovation, the developers will go elsewhere and will not be serving the country or its people.

Thank you very much.

<summary>u/LogrisTheBard finishes his post on decentralised identity</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11ufzg6/daily_general_discussion_march_18_2023/jco0gh3/)

Revised/finished post from the other day.

DID (Decentralized ID) systems are a hot topic right now. They are needed for everything from free to play games, social media networks, and airdrops to governance systems like OPs Citizens House. There is (rightly so) a lot of buzz and various takes on how to approach this topic. I think this is one of the existential risks of Defi and I've written about that [before](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/defi-governance-endgame/) (that sure aged well). I'm personally in favor of the [Gitcoin Passport](https://go.gitcoin.co/passport) framework that enables each user to define their own calculation for Sybil Resistance by identifying their stamps and then having an attestation system like I proposed [awhile ago](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/harnessing-collector-psychology-for-good/) compress long form off-chain calculations into simple on-chain maps. The focus of these systems ends at being a proof of humanity per address. They are specifically attempting to solve Sybil-resistance.

However, I think there is the potential to layer reputation systems like credit scores on top of Sybil-resistance and I think the potential of this is largely unexplored. For the sake of this discussion I'll limit reputation to being a purely quantitative, monetary history of honesty rather than history of competence, impact, or ideology. In that context reputation is synonymous with trust. If we want to keep this purely quantitative, what can we objectively measure about something (e.g. code, people, institutions, etc) that makes people trust it? Here are what I think are the three primary pillars of trust:

* **Social Attestation**. When someone signs off on a code review, they are making an attestation. Systems like BrightId and Proof of Humanity are entirely social attestations. These systems are inherently subjective and usually *gameable* so are unreliable on their own but much of the world is entirely built upon attestation layers (your government ID for example).

* **Time**. The longer something has been there the more time attackers have had to inspect it, identify a vulnerability, and attack it. The longer a person has been around the more opportunities have arisen that might lure them to dishonesty. In a permissionless system, time proves doubts to be illusory in the same way that a $20 bill on a busy street is probably fake or glued to the floor the longer it sits there.

* **Opportunity Cost of Honesty**. Watch carefully how trust is used once granted. Any position of trust is exploitable to some degree. Otherwise what are you trusting? Honesty is the degree to which an actor is *suboptimal at exploiting that trust*. Yes, I'm aware how unintuitive that definition of honesty sounds but that's as close as I've come to a formal definition. Your unexploited trust value (UTV) is your maximum exploitable trust - exploited trust.

These pillars stand together to form the base on which a credit system could be built. They are a subset of what Vitalik [identified](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html) in his post on legitimacy.

The first two are straightforward to measure. The latter is a bit more like measuring carbon deltas for Carbon Credits, Sybil values, or MEV because the maximum exploitable trust term is so subjective. With PoS Sybil-resistance is derived from the money you have. Conversely, your UTV is derived from the money you don't (in a sense). It's the money you *don't* have because you chose to be honest. This is akin to the forgery-resistance score from Gitcoin passport being floored at the amount you have spent/lost.

The fact that this is subjective (and potentially monetizable) will probably lead to competing standards for how to calculate it much like credit agencies today. Your address will have the equivalent of an Experian score from multiple aggregators which combines the three pillars above into a single number that anyone can query. Each Defi protocol could choose to use a different score, a combination of scores, or create their own score. Could this lead to abuse by an agency? Yes, but less than the current system which isn't permissionless. 

But how do you bootstrap trust if no one will give you a position of trust you can honor/exploit? You can't bootstrap a system like this based on unsecured loans without first getting robbed by a few ten-thousand *Sybilooors*. The capital efficient answer today is to get involved in communities until someone is willing to grant you trust based on social attestation and time alone. That lacks a certain scalability element though. I think we can do better, even while remaining permissionless. You have to rely on some form of *suboptimality* otherwise the system will be gamed for profit. So what forms of permissionless economic suboptimality are already on-chain? The few that come to mind for me are donations to public goods, unrealized losses on airdrops, suboptimal votes in the face of bribes, and delegated credit.

None of these are perfect. The first criteria requires money to bootstrap. The second and third may have ulterior selfish motives the system can't see. The fourth is basically an extension of social attestation and just begs the question. So how do you bootstrap trust on someone with nothing to give and nothing to lose? I have no good answer but the above is the beginning of a formulation.

Why does it matter? Because this value can be integrated into tokenomic systems. I mentioned unsecured lending above, which is probably the first thing that comes to mind when you hear credit system, but I think that's actually one of the worst use cases for this. To explain why, we first have to break Defi collateral into two categories. The first category is money used as collateral for good behavior but which doesn't have a credibly neutral recipient. ETH staking is the largest example of this category but there are many others. The only criteria here is that the system has an objective, enforceable slashing condition. In this category the money just needs to be forfeit by the staker but it doesn't need to **go anywhere**. The second category is money used to reimburse someone. This includes all your money markets, collateralized stablecoins, insurance protocols, etc. It is more viable to use UTV as collateral for the former category. I wouldn't recommend this for the Ethereum base chain because the data to calculate this is on the base chain and this is a subjective score, not credibly neutral.

So where does this get us? Take a PoS system (not DPoS, that's dumb). The purpose of this system is to reach consensus on something. There are two necessary economic components to a PoS system. First, you have to be able to reward honest actors to incentivize participation. Second, each actor needs something at stake they can lose by being dishonest so you have entropy of bad actors over time. I've never seen a system designed so the failure of the dishonest actors is the main reward driver of the honest ones so I assume any such system has a revenue stream attached to it. Now, could we use reputation credit/UTV for such a system in lieu of capital? It certainly satisfies the something at stake requirement. You just have to be able to prevent collusion in the system and prevent bad actors from joining at a faster rate than the dishonesty entropy.

To prevent collusion I'll rely what I call Bitcoin's/Satoshi's great insight. The failure rate of attacking a network scales super-linearly with the number of anonymous actors in that network. This is because the chance of leaking a secret scales exponentially with the network and there is a common Schelling point to unify against dishonest actors once a secret is exposed. This is the *primary* value of decentralization. Past a certain threshold it is safe and profitable to be honest and risky and expensive to be dishonest. So the key to preventing collusion is to increase decentralization and protect anonymity of actors. Defi satisfies this.

To solve dishonesty entropy we're just using a different collateral (which is still a scarce resource). Today we use capital for Sybil-resistance. This does not provably satisfy the entropy condition and so plutocratic attacks on PoS systems today are *possible*. Given the source of this alternative collateral (historical honesty) UTV may prove out to be a superior selection criteria for identifying honest consensus participants.

This actually creates a beautiful sort of flywheel. By acting honestly you build a reputation score. You can stake your reputation in order to promise certain services. By fulfilling your promise you generate both an income stream and further reputation. This creates a compounding benefit to continue acting honestly. A world in which honest actors can build an income stream predicated on their reputation and potentially bootstrapped through community service is also a basis for UBI. It's a step closer to the type of world in which I'd like to live. A few disclaimers though. First, nothing is ever fully proven to be trustworthy. Second, trust is not monotonically increasing. As systems or the world with which they integrate change trust in them fluctuates.

P.S. I've been asked to plug an on-topic game from the EVMaverick's called Layer Zero. The basic premise of the game is to willingly enter into a contract with a group of people who can all openly rug the contract. Everyone has to put a share of collateral into the pot to join. Anyone in the game can take the pot. If no one takes the pot then everyone is generating UTV at the pot size * participants. Conceptually, a set of non-conspiring participants in a game like this can generate more in UTV than the money at stake. While UTV as defined above is scarce if it can be generated faster than capital it could out-compete capital for shares of revenue streams because of this.

<summary>u/0xBOBA hasn't been checking price for the last 3 months and checks in with us</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11vd15b/daily_general_discussion_march_19_2023/jcv3xmn/)

I tried to not check prices.  I lasted 3 months.  I ended up checking because of the SVB news.  Good to see ETH up 50% since I left.  Makes me a little less worried about my CDP.  The $ARB airdrop was a nice surprise too.  Glad I didn‚Äôt miss it while I was gone.  The only other thing I was really worried about while I was gone were my non-ETH holdings. 

With withdrawals coming I finally gave up on my LINK and swapped them for RPL.  More confidence in RPL than LINK.  Should have done it long ago. I got too attached to my LINK and waited too long for the ratio to recover.  (I‚Äôm a horrible trader). Lesson learned there.  But I need an exit plan for RPL. It‚Äôs only 2% of my portfolio though.  

I‚Äôve used this drop in the ratio to unload most of my BTC.  Now only 3% of my portfolio. 0% at 0.055 if my limit orders go through. A part of me wants to keep a little bit of BTC just for nostalgic reasons but I really don‚Äôt see the point of BTC. I skimmed some of the recent dailies and see others offloading their BTC.  This probably means the ratio will continue to drop ‚òπÔ∏è

So now I am 95% ETH and too heavy in ETHE in my retirement funds. Feels nice (other than the horrible ETHE price: what‚Äôs going on there?).  It was kind of nice not checking the price for a few months, but I also missed reading the daily. 

I‚Äôll probably stick around to claim my $ARB and maybe until withdrawals are enabled.  Anything fun to do on Arbitrum these days?   Something that won‚Äôt make taxes a mess next year.

Airdrop Ideas? 

I recently joked with some friends at work about how the ARB airdrop would be my only work bonus this year and, of course, they got super interested. Last Xmas I gave them all RPL and it has tripled in value, but since then they haven't really done anything with defi or crypto. However, I think airdrop farming might just be the push that gets them swimming!

Meanwhile, more NFT shenanigans..

535 DeGods NFTs that had been previously burned in Ethereum, were "ressurrected" as ordinals in BTC, at 0.333 BTC per mint this past weekend. 

They all sold out in a single block.

The project dominated ordinals secondary markets, with over $1M in volume, ahead of YugaLab's twelvefold ordinals by >7x. It seems ordinals are here to stay, and more so if they are backed by already established brands such as DeGods.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11x8e2l/daily_general_discussion_march_21_2023/jd2b2kk/)

Yesterday some twitter user found out ~2400 compromised accounts all approving ARB. Someone analysed these (actually 2225) wallets and 1791 wallets are elligble for around 3 million ARB total.

<https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/sybil-detection/issues/3>

Many users became victim by following links under the announcement tweet. Suprised Arbitrum didn't provide the link to their website with the annoucement or turn off replies. They are not new to how crypto scams and hacks work.

<https://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1636352104913666050>

Frustrating to see that so much damage is done. Users have personal responsibility sure. But I think the damage wouldn't be this big if Arbitrum guided users to the right place. Maybe I am a bit unreasonable here... 

Stuff like this can't be happening if crypto ever wants to become 'mainstream'.

<summary>u/busterrulezzz has something to say about Balaji</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11y8xk3/daily_general_discussion_march_22_2023/jd7n6bh/)

I will take Balaji seriously when he goes to explain his theory to people who have the intellectual background to ask him the hard questions.

His appearance on Bankless and the Pomp show yesterday were appalling. Those weren't interviews, they were oral presentations. He could have said that Satoshi was going to come down from heaven to wash away our sins and give us eternal life, and the hosts would have nodded their heads and said "woah."

Balaji is not the intellectual he claims to be. An intellectual does not choose hosts sold out to his cause to make his point - instead, he will go directly to confront those who disagree. This is the very basis of the scientific method. I also find his tone to be alarmist, dramatic, filled with hyperbole created to capture attention.

Who is he, anyway? He is an engineer who became a multi-millionaire in the early 2010s - he has no expertise in finance, history or politics, beyond what he has read elsewhere. Ironically, he made his fortune from the system he says he wants to escape today. His claim to fame is that he "predicted" the pandemic on January 30, 2020. Except that on January 30th, the WHO declared a "global health emergency", Wuhan had already been cut off from the rest of the world, there were confirmed cases in dozens of countries... He was a bit early, sure, but it is not the feat he claims.

Finally, about his $1M prediction, he has already prepared his exit. In three months he will say, "Oh, the bet was just a wake-up call, you shouldn't have taken it at face value, I'm not sure about the timeline, but hyperinflation will happen soon." It won't happen, and he'll push the deadline again and again, until he disappear into irrelevance.

Brian Armstrong:
> 1/ Today Coinbase received a Wells notice from the SEC focused on staking and asset listings. A Wells notice typically precedes an enforcement action.    
> [...]    
> 4/ We are proud to stand up for our customers and the industry in these moments.

Honestly... best that Coinbase, who's well-capitalized and equipped to handle this, to be the one to go to court with the SEC and set a precedent. A win for crypto against the SEC in court would be a big deal and there's no one better poised to do that than CB.

Now, this is a story all about how

Our lives got flipped-turned upside down

And I'd like to take a minute

Just sit right there

I'll tell you how we became gentlemen of a sub called ethfinanci√©r:

-

In Ethereum Trader, born and raised

On the daily was where I spent most of my days

Chillin' out, meming, tradin', all cool

And all buying' some shitcoins outside of the school

-

When a couple of mods who were up to no good

Started making trouble in our neighborhood

We told them donuts are whack and jtnichol got scared

He said, "You're movin' with cutsnek into ethfinancier"

Lol holy crap bunch of dummies over there at NYAG office. At least Gensler's team understand crypto...

From: [https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=XDXIUrIw3tVafxqwEqVfKw==](https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=XDXIUrIw3tVafxqwEqVfKw==)

> Under proof-of-work, computers on the Ethereum network competed to answer amathematical puzzle in order to verify transactions on the blockchain and receive in-kind digital asset rewards. Under proof-of-stake, however, validators, pledge or ‚Äústake‚Äù their holdings in ETH and are randomly chosen to verify transactions on the blockchain and receive an in-kind digital asset reward. By shifting to proof-of-stake, ETH no longer relies upon competition between computers, but instead now relies on a pooling method that incentivizes users to own and stake ETH. The shift to proof-of-stake significantly impacted the core functionality and incentives for owning ETH, because ETH holders now can profit merely by participating in staking.

Lol, "*merely* by participating in staking" holy christ project much? Is this a highschoolers essay?

And why is it a security Ms AG?

> the Ethereum Foundation claims on its website that users of Ethereum ‚Äúsee it as a digital store of value because the creation of new ETH slows down over time.‚Äù

Lol just like bitcoin, which even Gensler has clearly stated is the only crypto he views as definitely NOT security? Can't even line up your arguments between agencies...

But wait there's more?

> Since transitioning to the proof-of-stake consensus, the value proposition has altered significantly because possession of ETH translates directly to profit potential by earning staking rewards

Hey everyone, did you realize that you're earning staking rewards just by holding Eth in your hardware wallet!!!!!

I have no idea how any of this will play out, but I can definitely say that NYAG is a fucking clown show compared the SEC when it comes to this stuff.

[u/KotMyNetchup](https://reddit.com/u/KotMyNetchup):

According to their latest tweet, Circle stands to lose 8% of the USDC backing at most. It sounds like the most reasonable expectation is that FDIC will be able to recover a decent amount of funds from SVB. I'm expecting >50% to be returned. But looking at the pessimistic side, we have a 4-8% haircut on USDC. $0.92-$0.96. We're seeing that price range now.

The next question is if prices close enough to that range can be sustained long enough for Circle to be able to inject liquidity into the market as needed. I don't know what mechanisms Circle uses to do this, other than promises and market forces. If it comes down to promises and market forces that might not be enough.

Another question is at what point USDC price starts to have knock on effects beyond a simple bank run. A lot of defi is built around USDC. What systems will start to deteriorate if USDC starts to depeg more? At what point do systems start to fall apart?

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11ngir4/daily_general_discussion_march_10_2023/jbn88dx/)

The first town hall for the [Summer of Protocols](https://mobile.twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1632847129545940992) happens tomorrow, about 9 hours from this comment. 

If you're interested in participating, highly recommend attending! I haven't finished reading the Unreasonable Sufficiency of Protocols (sort of a manifesto for the course) yet but it's really good so far, very thought-provoking, and I'm thinking of recording a version to listen to.

*edit*. quick synopsis of the Summer of Protocols if you're lazy: it's basically a brain incubator where some very thoughtful people are going to get together and try to define what a "protocol" is, examine existing examples, and how to design one that is future-proof, capable of ossifying to some degree, incentivizes good outcomes, and look at how much stewardship that thing will need. 

This is awesome and, in my mind, the kind of philosophical analysis that we need to make sure Ethereum (or any protocol) has a sufficient amount of thought put into it to try to steer away from some of the dystopian outcomes that something like the internet has brought about.

If algorithms on the internet can change people's behaviors to rapidly foster a kind of hatred that causes people to do things they otherwise wouldn't have, why wouldn't we assume that that behavior-changing power also works in the other direction to incentivize willing participants to better coordinate with each other? This is why I'm here. Because the infancy of Ethereum is the most exciting and malleable part and I think something like this is capable of stewarding it to a place where it actually makes a difference.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11ocbsl/daily_general_discussion_march_11_2023/jbtp31j/)

> Literally how can people outside the "cryptosphere" look at crypto and not think "scam"?

A quote from u/geliboy695000 earlier today and I want to repost it here for exposure and discussion because it's important. 

When you look at social media, any time the topic comes up or problems in crypto are brought up, the threads are flooded with bots and scammers shilling whatever shitcoin they get paid to shill. If I were not already in the space and knew what goes on I'd 100% think cryptocurrency is just scams all the way down. And just to be explicitely clear: Ethereum itself has enabled this too with ERC-20s and the like. [Just look at what's literal number 4 in market cap among those tokens](https://etherscan.io/tokens) and then scroll down further for all the less popular bs coins like Dogelon & co. 

We need to somehow find a way to exclude the grifters and scammers from the discussions while still being open and true to the crypto ideals, and also welcoming to newcomers and open to new ideas. It seems like mission impossible.

How can legitimate projects be promoted without at the same time giving exposure to the wrong people? How can the general public be educated, because it doesn't seem  knowledge of blockchain tech and its uses has increased that much in the mainstream over the past years. The majority of people still doesn't even seem to understand even just Bitcoin, which has been around for 13 years now and is arguably the most basic and among the easiest blockchains to understand in principle. 

This matters, because if most people do not understand how this tech can help society and how it works, they'll think it's useless and will support legislation that cracks down and hinders crypto adoption. They might cheer the criminalization of private non-KYCed wallets only to find a couple of years down the line to be forced to use CBDC and have banks not only control their money but monitor all their habits as well. It's probably not what the majority wants but if we don't help them understand they won't know anything about it.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11q1nrm/daily_general_discussion_march_13_2023/jc3nqn3/)

Dear EVMs, EIPanda‚Äôs and the ETHFinance community,

I come before you today to genuinely ask for your help. Please take the time to read this, I know it is long but I believe it is important. No jokes this time. Thanks in advance friends.

As you may or may not know, I started a website called ‚ÄúCaches.‚Äù If you‚Äôve never visited it, I will briefly explain. If you have, then you already know. Caches is a social network/community website focused on Web3 Technology and Ethereum. A place to explore all of the interesting technologies and ideas that are spinning off of this new paradigm that we all love. It‚Äôs completely anonymous, and membership is free and only available via Ethereum wallet login.

I intended for Caches to be somewhere for our community to teach, and share our knowledge outside of the walls of third parties like Reddit or Discord. Something we own, so our voices can be properly heard, and so they can‚Äôt be muted due to some draconian corporate attack on crypto or something. A place where you could ‚Äúcache‚Äù your content and share it with the world anonymously, using identity technology being pioneered by Ethereum. Our mark on the world outside our biosphere. I also hoped we could show the world how you build a community, powered by web3 technology, out here on the old www... A home.

Now I have a lot of ideas, but that‚Äôs the gist of it. I have spent a lot of time in this pursuit and I have struggled with it. The platform I chose to build Caches on, WordPress, has absolutely no help, plugins, or extensions for crypto/web3. Really no good CMS platform out there does. Since I am a terrible coder, and I am already familiar with developing websites rapidly using Wordpress, I chose to move forward using it to save time, for better or for worse. This has been an adventure to say the least.

Recently, I spoke with another EVM, [/u/juxtanotherposition](https://reddit.com/u/juxtanotherposition), and we immediately hit it off. Turns out, just by stroke of luck that on March 24th, 2023 he will be giving a presentation at WordCamp Phoenix on *‚ÄúWordpress, Community and Web3.‚Äù* Strange how the world works sometimes ‚Ä¶ Caches is built on Wordpress, it has custom developed Web3 authentication and NFT gating, and it was made for a community‚Ä¶ his very own community! This was literally a match made in heaven! So with all that said, we agreed to feature Caches during the presentation as an example of community built on Wordpress with web3 tech!

That means **we will have eyes from the Wordpress developer community focused on Caches and the EVM!** *AAAAHHHH!* This is why I need your help! Now look, I know I‚Äôm funny, and I make you laugh, and maybe you‚Äôve even checked out Caches once or twice to humor me, and then laughed yourself to sleep ... but I need them to see the value in this. Not just for me, or Caches, or the EVMs ‚Ä¶ for Ethereum.

**Why is Wordpress important?**

Wordpress is a free, open source content management system that powers an astounding **43% of all websites** online. I bet you didn‚Äôt know Caches ran on Wordpress before I told you, did you? A lot of your favorite sites run on it. It‚Äôs free, open source, community developed, and extensible. It also runs on a completely opensource technology stack. Wordpress.org develops the Wordpress software and they are a non-profit entity. Their ethos is very aligned with ours. They want to enable people to have their own platform to share their ideas, and words without having to rely on anyone. You can check out their [about us](https://wordpress.org/about/) page if you aren‚Äôt familiar with them.

**Why is this important for the community?**

Since Caches was built for the EVM/ETHFi community, we have a very unique opportunity to get our ideas, and our community out to potentially thousands of Wordpress developers who will be viewing Caches during @juxta‚Äôs presentation. They will undoubtedly share Caches with other developers. That means we have an opportunity to get web3 ideas and even our community baked into Wordpress! I literally can not think of a bigger opportunity for us, and for Ethereum. If we can get developers to create plugins, extensions, themes and more that enable and integrate web3 technology into Wordpress, we have an opportunity to put this in front of 43% of website owners WORLDWIDE! I can not think of a better group than all of you to guide and usher these people into this new paradigm.

With our help we can get this technology out to the world, and we can foster the Wordpress community during their exploration of this new technology. Give them a place to safely ask questions and get good answers ranging from JBM to Logris level. A place to share ideas, develop friendships and connections ‚Ä¶ just like we all have done through the sub. This is our opportunity to put the community at the forefront of something big outside our walls and build ourselves as an authority in this space.

**What‚Äôs in it for me?**

Juxta has asked if Caches could be a sort of ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù test bed for Wordpress web3 plugins and technology. I like this idea, we get free development work to make Caches the premier web3 community and the developers get a real live site to develop their product. This is a win/win/win! I get to see the thing I started grow and flourish at the hands of people much smarter and more capable than me. It‚Äôs beautiful man! That‚Äôs really it. I hope to use it to make money, however we decide to do that, just like you.

**What‚Äôs in it for you?**

I honestly built this site for our community. I genuinely built it to enable everyone to be heard out here on the web. As I have repeatedly stated, I don‚Äôt want to own this thing by myself. So I hope you can join me, we can come up with new ways to push Ethereum/web3 forward in the web2 and we can come up with creative ways for everyone in the community to earn some money for themselves without turning into a marketing machine. I want everyone to be a part of that journey, and I want everyone to be able to contribute ideas to that goal, and most importantly I want to work with you to figure out how we can own this thing together in the fairest way possible. I don‚Äôt have any of that figured out, but that‚Äôs ultimately where I want to be‚Ä¶ a community owned and operated by the community.

**How can I help?**

Pop in the EVM discord. If you're not an EVM, I still want your help. Please. Join the public-channel and DM a mod to have the "Caches" role added to your account and then you'll be able to see the #caches channel there even if you don't have an EVM. I will use that to try to collaborate and focus our energies best I can. I need you! We have just 10 days to try and make Caches, the community and Ethereum look good... but hey... this is just the beginning. So don't do it for me. Do it for **ETHEREUM.**

Sincerely,  
JBM üëäüèª

Ethtrader donuts were key in the formation of this sub. Not just because it triggered the exodus, but because of the type of people it promoted to leave. 

The people that hate grifts and cash grabs, the people that see this as more than a way to make money, the people that are in it for the tech, etc.

It distilled the community down to those that believe in the original ethos ethereum was founded on, and we do our best to carry forward.

Meanwhile in the NFT-verse..

Reporting from the trenches of the great marketplace wars of '23. OpenSea has engineered their next move to combat Blur's rapid ascent into the market. What did they do?

Introduce a new table view! Where the NFT jpg is reduced to a few pixels, just like in Blur. The way art was always meant to be traded!

On a more serious note, this war has already caused some collateral damage, with the royalties race to the bottom. The argument goes that 10k profile picture collections probably should not have royalties, while it makes more sense for 1/1 art pieces. 

Well, the royalties paid on ArtBlocks (an NFT platform for curated artists) has now gone from 7.5% to 2.5%. This suggests that the markets for these two types of NFTs may not be so different after all.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí]()

Yesterday two things that longterm members posts and that are not connected somehow caught my attention and made me think. The first one was [this post](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11evx0c/comment/jahzvw8/) by Bob Rossi, the second one was [a comment](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11evx0c/comment/jah4v8c/) by superphiz in a completely different thread. 

Some personal thoughts with regards to Bobs post: I totally feel you. I want to contribute more in the space and think I would be able to add some value here and there, but hell I am just a random anon on the internet that's mid bell curve. 

But what if superphiz is right (and I think he is)? What if EVMs (which I am going to replace with members of this sub, since not everyone does hold one) will become community guardians? What if this place is something special and if you have established yourself as a valuable and know community member you are highly likely to add value to projects in the ETH ecosystem, hence also hop? What if we used the community we have built here to send people to different DAOs to positively influence decisions made in the ecosystem? What if at one point any EVM and their arguments in a (DAO) discussion are seen with different eyes just because of the NFT?

<summary>Ecosystem: u/wolfparking covers ERC-4337</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11gsztq/daily_general_discussion_march_3_2023/jatsizb/)

This was deployed at the EthDenver conference: [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337). Am I right to think that this is a really underrated implementation?

I've read from a few sources that this level of account abstraction will eventually allow wallets to operate as programmable smart contracts; which could be used to recover lost private keys. We're not there yet, but still exciting!

News articles: [msn.com](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/ethereum-activates-account-abstraction-touted-by-co-founder-buterin-as-key-advance/ar-AA186sIg) and
[BusinessInsider](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/ethereum-activates-account-abstraction-touted-by-founder-buterin-as-key-advance-1032137536)

> Could allow users to do away with the common practice of backing up a set of words on a piece of paper, enabling new ways to secure wallets. For example, users could set up two-factor authentication to access a wallet via biometric data, or program multi-signature wallets providing shared access to a single account.

Additionally, this:

> Vitalik Buterin has stated that ERC-4337 enables a fully decentralized fee market for smart contract wallet operations.

Vitalik [posted](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1576199517434949634): 

> You should be able to send an op into a public mempool, and if it pays enough fees, reliably expect it to get included. This should NOT depend on ANY:
> 
> * Centralized actors
> * Reputation systems for op senders
> * ETH held in a separate EOA
> * External services for account creation

With L2 fee structure the fee requirement diminishes. 

I'm not technically skilled/knowledgeable enough to understand why this integration won't presently allow account recovery, but we're almost there apparently. Vitalik mentions that it can't be solved by ERC-4337, but EIP-3074 and EIP-5003 would get us there. Very cool shit. Anyone want to chime in on anything I misunderstood?

<summary>Ecosystem: u/hanniabu discusses Privacy Pools, the successor to Tornado Cash in response to the OFAC regulation</summary>

Really surprised to see the Tornado Cash successor Privacy Pools isn't being discussed in more detail here

[https://twitter.com/ameensol/status/1632083054272430080](https://twitter.com/ameensol/status/1632083054272430080)

Since anybody can exclude any deposit, it seems it would be difficult to get any type of assurance of your anonymity set.

I also wonder if you can run into a situation where you can't withdraw. For example if a hacker makes a large deposit and then withdraws for others, then there won't be enough funds for everyone else to withdraw if they all want to exclude the hacker.

And not sure why the subsets are even needed if receipts are provided, which Tornado Cash already did.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11ip8sx/daily_general_discussion_march_5_2023/jb1i37k/)

BUIDL Week is over here at EthDenver. You may have noticed a lack of a certain [u/logristhebard](https://reddit.com/u/logristhebard) around the subreddit. That's because he has been diligently working on the [Logris Vaults](https://app.buidlbox.io/projects/logrisvaults). Some of you saw the Alpha that I dropped earlier in the week... we are now one step closer to the [Double Logris](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-double-logris/) becoming a reality. 

It's been a long week and Logris has been working flat out to get the project across the finish line. We're about to pitch in a little bit here... still waiting on our time so I can't tell you that. But, I'm really excited about what we accomplished and really Really REALLLLLYYYY proud of him. 

Logris says he's proud of [this function](https://github.com/DavionKalhen/LogrisV1/blob/78b5cc87fe29c7222b38da6624cf9e12503d54af/src/leveragers/EulerCurveMetaLeverager.sol#L158). What a nerd.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11jq6y5/daily_general_discussion_march_6_2023/jb48g07/)

**ETHDenver Day 10** ([Yesterday](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11ip8sx/daily_general_discussion_march_5_2023/jazo2by/))

The final day of ETHDenver! There were no traditional talks from established companies or researchers; today was all about the hackathon teams. Each project was submitted to one of five tracks (DeFi, Impact / Social Goods, DAOs / Community, NFT/Gaming/Metaverse, and Infrastructure) and could also compete for sponsor bounties ([big list here](https://app.buidlbox.io/ethdenver/ethdenver-2023)).

Projects had to be submitted by 8 AM, then from 10-2 teams showed off what they made. On the regular presentation stages, teams went up to the stage corresponding to their track and gave a 1:30 pitch and demo, with a little time for questions. When they weren't on stage, they were downstairs in the main buidl room where the sponsor bounty judges and random attendees could learn about what they made. Track judges picked the top three of each track to present on the main stage during the closing ceremony at 3 PM, then five final winners were chosen.

Miscellaneous notes: I don't think I can see an overall list of hackathon projects, but each one does have their own page if you know what URL to go to. But for most I don't know the URL so it's going to be hard to link to them. I also heard that there was a major hiccup where in the midst of planning out judging, a bunch of teams just got missed entirely and weren't scheduled for a pitch slot or a table location. The team worked to resolve it, but with everything happening so fast some teams were just screwed over. Hopefully it's better next year. Also I finally checked out the arcade area, good collection of imported Japanese arcade games, nice selection of rhythm games in particular.

* [**Logris Vaults:**](https://app.buidlbox.io/projects/logrisvaults) A good place to start off the list. DoubtStars has been [talking about this project](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11ip8sx/daily_general_discussion_march_5_2023/jb1i37k/) so I don't really need to. I didn't find the team on the buidl floor, but I can throw it on here anyway because it's cool.
* **ChainRep:** A project to put security audits and reports (or at least links and a general rating) on-chain. Reviews point to the smart contract in question, and are written by reviewers who are issued certificates by trusted entities like the EF or something. So you could potentially make a DeFi protocol that generally works with any ERC20 token, but checks ChainRep and only allows tokens with positive reviews from certified reviewers.
* **MintUI:** A library of React components for web3 that share information between one another to make web3 programming easier. Main example (as the name would imply) is NFT minting.
* **Composooor:** Would appreciate more insight into this. The team was saying something about how it's hard to build composable dapps/protocols using other protocols that rely on off-chain data. So this is a MetaMask snap (bounty hunting ho!) that simplifies this composability and significantly reduces the amount of code you need to create a clean integration.
* **Dual Rollup:** Cartesi is an [existing platform](https://docs.cartesi.io/cartesi-rollups/overview/) I'm only just learning about for developing optimistic rollups whose execution environment is literally a [Linux VM on RISC-V](https://docs.cartesi.io/machine/intro/). This project uses that to run a ZK *prover* on Cartesi, or ultimately a ZK rollup on an optimistic rollup. I get the concept but I feel like I'm barely able to grasp the implications. The team suggested you may be able to implement a universal (or at least cross-EVM) ZK bridge.
* **Alice's Ring:** A project for proof of solvency. With it, tenant Alice can prove to landlord Bob that she has enough assets to cover rent, notably *without revealing the actual address to Bob*. Then, if Alice later uses [zkBob](https://www.zkbob.com/) to actually pay her rent, Bob may never actually have to see Alice's actual assets. The team says that the proof must be computed over multiple blocks or something in order to prevent someone from proving solvency after taking a flash loan. But nothing is stopping Alice from generating the proof then immediately selling, transferring, or gambling it away.
* **Artist Hunger Games:** A pretty wild project in which artists get paid to participate in a hunger-games style game. A DAO of NFT holders have the ability to vote on which artists get removed from the game each round, and can also do silly votes on things like telling the artists where to live or eat. Make it a reality show kind of thing. I was reminded of [Mark](https://www.ted.com/talks/mike_merrill_how_i_became_the_world_s_first_publicly_traded_person) [Merrill](https://www.wired.com/2013/03/ipo-man/), who famously sold off shares of himself.
* **CryptoTaco:** A point-of-sale tool for merchants to accept crypto for payments without having to worry about keys or wallets or whatever. Uses [Magic's](https://magic.link/) tools to onboard merchants using their email addresses. These guys had a lot of enthusiasm, but I'm not sure they're fully aware of how busy this space is. Hasn't bitpay been doing this since 2013 or something?
* **QuestGPT:** Basically [AI Dungeon](https://play.aidungeon.io/main/home) implemented as a Discord chatbot, using DALL-E to create images related to the story which are then minted as NFTs. Pretty nice user experience in the end. Not quite the same degree of control as AI Dungeon gives you though. I was told they use multiple AIs (all GPT?) working together to keep track of context/worldstate and regularize the story.
* **Factorial:** Modular libraries/tools for building DeFi protocols, one example being a "liquidation module" for any time you may need to do something analogous to liquidating a user's position.

The following are the finalists who presented at the closing ceremony. These were short talks and it was easy to miss critical details, so this may be quick.

* **Sesame (Winner!):** Allows you to use Ethereum on your phone without internet by sending data over SMS. Has a little wallet interface that can update ETH market price and portfolio value, and lets you send simple transactions.
* **FundPG (Winner!):** A no-loss donation pool that allows users to specify some percentage of their yield to go to public goods.
* **Krypto Kredit:** Some sort of credit score platform using [Huma](https://huma.finance/). Kind of missed the details.
* **Bitcoin Vitalik's Vision:** Fork of the OP stack to post data on Bitcoin, inspired by ordinals of course. Team answered a question about their experience by saying "it sucks to build on Bitcoin".
* **Swappy (Winner!):** Token swaps using natural language queries. You type in "Swap 5 USDC on Ethereum for MATIC on Polygon" and it parses it with GPT, prompts you if you're missing anything, constructs the actual details of the swap, lets you visualize and confirm it, then executes.
* **Rhinestone:** My notes on this literally say "something something account abstraction" sorry.
* **Slang:** Lets you write a single command to generate code to integrate with Ceramic (decentralized data storage) as if it were a web2 database.
* **Inheritable:** Web3 wills for inheritance. Puts inheritances in a Merkle tree for verifying claims. Lets you establish a group of Witnesses who attest/vote that you're dead to start the inheritance process.
* **BaZaarK (Winner!):** I believe this was about selling an NFT but using ZP proofs to do so without revealing all of its traits. May find some specialized use cases.
* **MyMule:** Virtual pet game with a 3D environment where the pets are NFTs. If you interact with it regularly and keep it happy, it prints some ERC20 tokens for you. If you let its happiness bar go to zero then it dies.
* **Synesthesia:** Collecting music NFTs isn't as fun as JPEG NFTs because of the difference in medium. This project creates generative art for each piece of music based on its metadata to make catchy pictures to go along with them.
* **ZKpoEx (Winner!):** This provides a way for auditors to create a ZK proof that an exploit (generally agnostic to the type of exploit) exists, without revealing the specific details of how it works. Good way to do responsible disclosure. Probably my favorite out of the finalists.
* **Tribe.Credit:** P2P lending protocol. You can deposit some capital, then it connects to your phone's contact list and you can say how much you'd be willing to lend that person. If they borrow from you, you don't get to see who exactly it is or how much. If they don't repay you then identity gets revealed and they get kicked out.
* **GasPay (listed as Gasly elsewhere):** Simple token swap tool that just adds the ability to pay for gas in whatever token you want.
* **Denoted:** A medium/hackmd/notion kind of writing site that integrates with all sorts of crypto data and analytics tools to create graphs and visualizations embedded in the posts. Generated dynamically so can update over time.
* **M3mber:** I think this is a way to mint an NFT that represents a membership in something with an expiry date (pitched as a way for DAOs to bring in recurring money like a subscription rather than just the one-off token sale). They use ENS domains, with [NameWrapper](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/tree/master/contracts/wrapper) to accomplish this; is it only because ENS domains already have expiry built in so they don't have to code it from scratch?
* **GovBlocks:** DAO management platform. Modular design, has useful things you would expect like DAO members being able to start a vote to change a governance parameter.

That was actually the last day. Some people are sticking around for the mountain retreat, but that's not really something to report on. I'll assemble a final review tomorrow and that'll be it!

https://www.veritasanalyticsllc.com/finacial-forensics-news/2023/3/6/law360-op-ed-crypto-is-a-major-question-only-appellate-courts-can-answer

Interesting legal op-ed about the potential future of crypto regulation as the Ripple case progresses through the courts.

TLDR: The conservative supreme court has renewed interest in containing federal agencies to the powers explicitly defined by congress evidenced by WV vs. EPA ruling last year referencing the "major questions doctrine" in the ruling. Regardless of the outcome in lower courts for Ripple vs. SEC, the ruling is likely to be appealed to higher courts and this author at least thinks the SEC's authority over crypto assets falls under the "major questions doctrine" that needs to be decided by congress and could potentially neuter Gensler's further attempts to destroy the industry in the US.

Notes are personal and often contain personal information, subtle details about your life and your extremely valuable intellectual property like your unreleased raps. Are you going to trust that level of information to Evernote!? OneNote!? You know who just bought Evernote? Bending Spoons. You know what Bending Spoons does? AI‚Ä¶ yeah. They want your raps bro! Don‚Äôt even get me started on Microsoft (OpenAI) OneNote! *Ahhhhhhh!*

So, today I present an open source, self hosted, zero knowledge, end to end encrypted note taking app named [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org). Joplin is a full featured notes app with markdown support, image/website/screen clip insertion support and so much more! Syncing between your mobile and desktop can be done with Joplin‚Äôs paid cloud service but they also support S3, Nextcloud, WebDAV, Dropbox, OneDrive or the local filesystem (syncthing?), so you don‚Äôt have to pay more for their cloud if you don‚Äôt want.

They have fully featured, open source apps for Android/iOS and Linux, Windows, Mac and ‚Ä¶ FreeBSD!? *Whoah! So hardcore!* Even the Joplin cloud server software is open source‚Ä¶ ohhh! and ‚Ä¶ and there‚Äôs a terminal app for my fellow shell dwellers out there. You can really feel the nerd love here.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11lo2v3/daily_general_discussion_march_8_2023/jbf8b5h/)

You all know, this bear is a builder. Here are some newish, not-so-well-known Defi protocols. As they are new, they are not battle-tested and deployed capital are potentially at risk. Don‚Äòt ape in with your life savings.

**Numoen.com** \- an AMM on Arbitrum which let you access leverage with no liquidation penality, oracleless. It‚Äòs done as a power perpetual ETH\^2. But there is a price,you pay relatively high funding rates so it‚Äòs rather good for short term trades. 

**Sturdy.finance** \- another leverage protocol. Here you can leverage up DEX pool tokens or alternatively lend your ETH/stables to the one using leverage.

**Contango.xyz** \- you can buy or sell a forward contract, and contango borrows on the fixed-rate markets, swaps on the spot markets, and lends back on the fixed rate markets. Sounds complicated, but also fascinating money lego. Be aware: very early stage, in beta with unaudited contracts!

**Ondo.finance** / **fluxfinance.com**: Ondo is gate-keeped (100k min. deposit), so I‚Äòm not sure if you manage to get into their pools (I‚Äòve not tried it). But if not, you can get relatively high APY (currently) on stables (USDC,USDT or DAI) by depositing into their partner protocol fluxfinance.

**IPOR.io** \- an Inter-protocol Offered Rate for Decentralized Finance. It‚Äòs too complicated to explain it in simple words by myself, so I refer to their elaborate documentation: https://docs.ipor.io/

<summary>Ecosystem: u/Ethical-trade and u/etheraider share Coinbase's latest release and how it validates Ethereum's scaling strategy
</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/119q5kg/daily_general_discussion_february_23_2023/j9oq1yx/)

[u/Ethical-trade](https://reddit.com/u/Ethical-trade):

In the past, Binance launched its own L1 with the Binance Smart Chain.

FTX launched its own L1 with Solana.

But today [Coinbase commits to Ethereum by launching its own L2 on Ethereum](https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1628760201254903809).

This means than Coinbase's interests are now fully aligned with Ethereum, with bridging of users and capital directly to the Ethereum ecosystem. 

This means that marketing made by Coinbase for its chain will now directly benefit Ethereum.

Eth is this L2's native token, with which gas will be paid.

This fully validates Ethereum's rollup centric roadmap.

[u/etheraider](https://reddit.com/u/etheraider):

While some may find the Coinbase "Base" news underwhelming or would have hoped for something different, the way I see it, this is a huge signal in the crypto space that the number one crypto company in the world is choosing to go all in on building on Ethereum. 

Up until now you could argue Coinbase was "impartial" in its offerings and did not show favoritism amongst coins, but now it seems they are willing to forego impartiality to build on the project they believe in most.

They couldve chosen to enhance lightning network/build an alternative, or build on solana, or the "new" smart contract enabled Cardano, but no they chose Ethereum.

That is something I would consider "significant."

<summary>Ecosystem: u/Maleficent_Plankton goes into detail on the Polygon outage</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11ak2qc/daily_general_discussion_february_24_2023/j9sjnjy/)

**Yesterday's Polygon validator "outage" was wild**:

1. There was a [157-block reorg](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/157-block-reorg-at-block-height-39599624/11388)
1. The [block explorer](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/22/polygon-blockchain-suffers-apparent-outage/) went down for an hour
1. Many validators (at least 25) went out of sync and continued to have issues syncing for 12-24 hours.

It was big enough that:

1. Polygon rushed out a **new governance proposal**, [PIP-9](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-9-performance-benchmark-adjustment/11387/4), and passed it within 12 hours. This proposal reduced validator SLA requirements from 98% back to 95% in order to [save 18-23 validators](https://staking.polygon.technology/validators) from getting offboarded due to missing their checkpoints SLA.
1. The co-founder of Polygon stated that they are exploring **[replacing their entire Bor/Heimdall blockchain consensus protocol](https://twitter.com/mihailobjelic/status/1628926312076423170)** with a single-blockchain solution.

**Background**: What happened is that several Polygon validators experienced sync issues, which then lead to giant cascade of outages for most validators. The reason for the reorg is supposedly [a bug between their Bor and Heimdall layers](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/157-block-reorg-at-block-height-39599624/11388), though the team has yet to give details on the bug.

**Checkpoint SLAs**: Back in Aug 2022, there was a governance proposal, [PIP-4](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-4-validator-performance-management/9956), to move towards permissionless validation.

> "In its current state, the PoS validator network is not entirely permissionless in that the previously-selected set of validators has largely persisted since testnet."

The proposal added an SLA requirement that 95% of median average of last 700 checkpoints are signed by the validator. If the validator fails to meet the SLA, they are placed in a Grace Period have another 700 checkpoints to meet it. Otherwise, they get offboarded from staking. After 2 months, the SLA increased from 95% to 98%.

**What happened yesterday concerning the checkpoint SLA**:

Due to this rule and validators missing checkpoints yesterday, 25 out of 100 validators were at risk of getting kicked off staking.

The emergency PIP-9 vote to reduce the SLA was passed, saving most of the validators. Only 2 validators got offboarded and 5 more are in the Grace Period.

It's good they're finally taking the reorg issue more seriously, but I think they should've addressed this a long time ago.

<summary>Random: u/austonst is doing the ETHDenver daily recaps</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11bdlrh/daily_general_discussion_february_25_2023/j9xiefc/)

**ETHDenver Day 1**

Last year, I attended ETHDenver and [made a post each day in which I primarily summarized the best talks I heard that day](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/sxm6cx/daily_general_discussion_february_21_2022/hxswh7b/), and also commented a little about my general experiences at the conference. ETHDenver 2023 has now begun, and I intend to do the same this year. As with last year, the first few days are slow: only one stage with talks starting late and ending early. So not too much to cover.

It seems that, also like last year, [all talks are recorded to Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/ethereumdenver), one stream per stage. But for a given talk, figuring out which stage and what timestamp is not trivial. It's not *too* hard either, and for today I figured I'd try tracking down timestamps but I'm really skeptical that I'll want to spend the time on that as the days get longer. If there's one you really want to see, let me know and I can probably find it pretty quick given that I know what the different stages are and can probably recognize the style of a given talk's slides at a glance. But in general I'll link to the schedule page for each talk, which should be enough to point you in the right direction for learning more.

* [Rick Lamanna, Founder of OpenQ](https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/d4ef6cc0-2bea-4408-bc63-72d41993415d/8d679f4b-a4d9-4450-9996-571b694850a2) ([video](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1747797444?t=4h14m2s)) talked about crypto hackathons. Gave some general advice on how to best participate and pursue bounties, and then mentioned some trends such as the prevalence of bounties meaning that hackathon teams are starting to say "if you don't pay a bounty for us to use your tool, we're not going to use it".
* [u/DoubtStarsAreFire and u/htimsk of Luau DAO](https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/c4b2f0e5-058d-4dba-9452-0d4033ef98fb/585f5cdd-dc90-4620-b6ab-12ce4f5bb13f) ([video](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1747797444?t=4h36m16s)) talked about Hodlercon, which needs no introduction here. It was a fun talk about a fun event, good vibes all around. I personally would have been interested in some more of the behind-the-scenes about what it takes to form a Wyoming DAO (and why to do so) and organize a group vacation while maintaining participant pseudonymity, but the conference organizers surprised them last minute with this day-1 timeslot so I know there were some serious time constraints.
* [Brian Wilkes](https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/fbd6c346-8883-4ed6-9220-68bc17f4770e/c32b46bc-57e5-4fe0-b3df-500718789823) ([video](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1747797444?t=5h2m43s)) gave a nice overview of zero knowledge proofs as applied to Ethereum scaling. Nothing particularly new to me, but I think it could be a nice overview or refresher for many.
* [Josh Forman of ShapeShift DAO](https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/a1236544-05ff-43a9-868e-294cc40eca14/e0b04682-d3a7-4757-87a4-4595a63decd7) ([video](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1747797444?t=5h26m50s)) covered ShapeShift's experience operating as a DAO, and in particular how they fared during a period of serious bear market financial woes. There are some good general insights into DAO structure and operation that I found myself able to relate to the EVMavericks DAO. Some of his main lessons: be clear about your governance process, don't try to figure out too much ahead of time, keep open and transparent communication, leadership and hierarchy can exist but should be delegated (and can be revoked) by the community.

On a personal note, it's kind of amazing how much I expect my experience at ETHDenver will be different this year. Last year I knew nobody personally and was generally content to fill my days with nothing but listening to talks and occasionally chatting with strangers. But this year? I didn't go half an hour before I started bumping into folks I know. I have [a project](https://www.aestus.live/) that I can explain to people who ask what I've been working on (and they seem to find it very interesting (!), but I need to stop assuming that everyone knows how staking and MEV work). I tentatively have a hackathon team (with folks from this community) for a project I think will be bite-sized but still quite valuable. And I need to juggle driving back home occasionally for some classes I'm taking, so I've accepted I'm going to have limited free time this next week. But it'll just be packed so full of fun things!

EDIT: Oh yeah, I also have the EVMavericks t-shirts for those who signed up on Discord. I won't be lugging around the huge box everywhere I go, but I'll try to set aside multiple timeslots when I can set up shop in one spot, let everyone know, and hand them out. Got 100 EVMavs stickers to hand out too.

[u/stablecoin](https://reddit.com/u/stablecoin):

Can't believe there's this many upvotes. Off the top of my head I can think about:

* Finalizing the Merge Event end of March kicking off a major staking reshuffling for probably the first and last time in the networks history. Every single LSD that has a shot need to make their move in the next 2-6 months or possibly never gain share again. Keeping an eye on RPL, BTRFLY, FXS, SWISE for possible shorter term catalysts.
* Upcoming Arbitrum token event, huge amount of new protocols launching on Arbitrum daily lately.
* Launch of final Scroll Network Open Testnet on Goerli announced just today: <https://twitter.com/Scroll_ZKP/status/1630258973856395264>
* Polygon ZKEVM launching March 27: <https://twitter.com/sandeepnailwal/status/1629736205720977408>
* Optimism TVL continuing to grow, Synthetix and Velodrome updates in the works.
* Base (Coinbase) announcement, dapps and onboarding sooon
* Starkware should continue to drip out news/updates as all these other L2 catalysts take shape, still waiting on their main net launch
* New Rocketpool LSD built on top of RPL to scale Rocket Pool and decentralized staking <https://twitter.com/NodeOperators/status/1630310094981468161>
* ZK Sync onboarding dapps getting ready for their main net launch (soon tm)
* Blur passing Open Sea in volume for many days now, currently lots of active farming possibilities for useless JPGS
* Yuga Labs announcing new NFT project with Bitcoin Ordinals
* Sensible EU stablecoin and defi adoption
* SEC fights against everyone claiming it's a security

This bear market is honestly so much harder to keep track of developments than the last one. All you could do last bear was take a Maker CDP loan and wait for Michael Saylor to buy Bitcoin. Maybe price action stinks but you can never say crypto is boring.

[Edit] Also just remembered Spotify NFTs, Starbucks Polygon NFT rollout in progress, and some of my Reddit WSB NFT's getting a nice premium lately.

[u/cryptOwOcurrency](https://reddit.com/u/cryptOwOcurrency):

Money should be boring. The fact that we had exciting money for a few years (bootstrapping/awareness phase of Bitcoin, then of Ethereum) is a marvel in the history of money.

If you think about it, new types of money don't pop up very often. In the history of money, we've only really had three major types, invented in 6000 BC, 600 BC, and 2008 CE.

* Physical barterable commodities as monies (backed by physical utility, 6000 BC)
* Trust-based monies (backed by their utility in abstracting away the trade of these cumbersome physical commodities by instead trading surrogate notes representing promises made by a trusted authority, 600 BC)
* Self-sovereign monies (monies that exist nowhere and everywhere as information that polices itself as it floats around, backed by their utility in eliminating the need for surrogacy or trust in creating abstract monies, 2008 CE).

You could argue that the jump from gold-backed notes to fiat notes was another fundamental evolution of money, but in any case we have been very lucky to live through this incredibly special decade.

So now begins the long, boring process of executing on the existing roadmap, and integrating Ethereum with the old, boring economy. We've had our big bang moment for this three thousand year period - perhaps in another three thousand years civilization will come up with yet another fundamentally new type of money and we'll see another big bang (thousands of years from now, quantum physics may allow us to have conversations with the laws of physics and directly ask those laws of physics to enforce certain constraints on our reality, a.k.a. "magic").

In three thousand years though, if the word "I" still makes sense to describe me, if I am even aware at that point of the events taking place on planet Earth in the material plane, and humans do invent a fourth type of money, at that point I probably won't care.

<summary>OPSEC: u/Tricky_Troll has some spiel about spammers and the report button</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11d4bra/daily_general_discussion_february_27_2023/ja9t6dn/)

Thanks for those of you vigilantly reporting the spam post on the front page. A quick dive into the user posting it and the other user commenting in support of the scam found a history of similar posts with the same free reddit awards. Don't trust any supposed uncollateralised DeFi protocols. They're almost certainly a scam unless basically everyone is talking about such a breakthrough.

Reminder of things to look out for in identifying spam and scams on Reddit:

**Spam posts: (if yes it's probably a scam)**

- Did they gain a lot of upvotes in the first 20 mins and then stop gaining traction?
- Does the user history have lost of similar posts or low effort comments about the same product posted by different users?
- Does the post have lots of low tier Reddit awards with relatively few upvotes?
- Does the user have low karma or karma farming indications like having a history of posting in random or low effort subs?
- Does the user and other users commenting in support of the post have a generic usernames with a shared pattern such as "AmazingReindeer123" or "GlowingPancake4679"?

Aside from this, there are some basic rules such as:

- If someone you don't know DM'd you it's probably a scam. Even if you want to be polite and respond to an unexpected DM, don't reveal any info or click any links until you're sure they are legit.
- If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
- If something raises even just one of the above flags, do some googling and delve into who else is talking about it. If you're seeing no organic looking chat about it then it's probably a scam.

Please remember to use the report button! In a sub with active mods multiple reports always signals to the mods that something needs investigating.

For those of you who are interested, this is the user who posted it and take a look and see if you can see the patterns of a scammer in their posts and post history. <https://reddit.com/user/SpicateHammer451>

Stay safe out there, folks!

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11evx0c/daily_general_discussion_march_1_2023/jah8knp/)

My brother: So how's it going with that secret little thing you are doing with Ethereum, that miner sitting on your desk? You must be very smart how do you manage it? Must be a lot of work.

Me thinking: Oh that's right I'm running a validator I almost forgot.

That thing is still running perfectly turning dust into ETH without looking at it for months. Yes, staking is very hard and mind consuming. All I do is wait for my phone to prompt an update and then I run the ethstaker wizard after a few weeks. I am very sramt!

This week I managed to get my coworker into solo staking without telling him I am one myself, but I think he knows. Dude is already heavily invested in getting the best performance out of his machine. What a nerd (He's actually a very nice guy that just loves computers). Tells me he has a lot of unused parts freshly bought just because they were off price. He was flabbergasted about the low specs needed and was kind of disappointed. I guess he was expecting to run some sort of data center in his home?

Maybe I'll tell him to run a Solana node instead, if he really wants to drown in debt and get no profit at all (even run at a loss). Good thing is that he understands. He immediately linked the correlation about decentralization needing easy hardware to work the most efficient. Can't expect normal people to run data centers right? They have the money, but not the technical knowledge. They do not want a beefy machine taking their electricity and bandwidth away. These were his exact words, and I was astounded by his quick thinking.

I wanted to direct him to the right sources to run a validator but he was already talking about running Geth and Lighthouse and was talking about all sorts of Linux command stuff. He was already smarter then me about validating in one day. I guess he's going to be just fine.

Coworker, if you manage to cross this post and recognize me. Doxx me and I will tell your mother!!

<summary>u/superphiz has a disclosure to make but it still putting values first</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/113jhtv/daily_general_discussion_february_16_2023/j8t3bo9/)

I want to disclose that I've contracted with EY to offer community education regarding their Nightfall and Starlight products for a few months. This isn't a full time job, just an agreement to spend more time learning about Nightfall and Starlight, then sharing what I've learned.

Let me give you some idea what this means. My credibility to the community is the most important thing I have in crypto, so I'll never do or say anything that would degrade that credibility. Many people who know and trust me hold that trust because I'm extremely selective about things I talk about. I focus on highly aligned projects that add value to the whole ecosystem and don't extract value for anyone. You might know that EY's privacy tools led by Paul Brody's team fill that niche for me, and I'm very confident about that fit after knowing Paul several years.

My intention is to learn more and share more about Nightfall and Starlight and help them find the traction they deserve and I hope you'll join me in this quest. If these tools succeed in the market, Ethereum will be the greatest beneficiary.

I need you to know that I can't be bought. I'm agreeing to this contract because it's good for the web3 community, our community, Ethereum, and EY. I believe that any greater knowledge we develop about these products will benefit all parties in the long run.

I will always continue to do my best to earn your trust as I find the best tools and opportunities to share with other Ethfinanciers, but I also need you to put your own judgement first. Ask yourself if I'm doing things that make sense for all of us or if I've lost my way. Follow your own good judgement, not mine. <3

<summary>u/SikhSoldiers covers the RocketPool x Coinbase Ventures partnership</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/114c6on/daily_general_discussion_february_17_2023/j8vjsek/)

> We are always happy and willing to be ambassadors for the benefits of decentralisation and how that can provide a deep benefit for all those involved. So it is with great pleasure that we want to relay that Coinbase Ventures has invested in the protocol. We recently announced their intentions to join the oDAO, so this is just another step in them willing to back a decentralised staking protocol such as Rocket Pool.
  
"We're excited to announce that Coinbase Ventures is deepening its partnership with Rocket Pool via a direct investment into RPL in addition to its proposed entry into the oDAO. Coinbase Ventures also plans to use their RPL and ETH to spin up their own Rocket Pool minipools."

From the Rocket Pool discord. Pretty impressive evolution of the CB Ventures x Rocket Pool relationship.

<summary>u/15kisFUD asks if Coinbase spinning up RocketPool nodes is good, bad or neutral for decentralization</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/114c6on/daily_general_discussion_february_17_2023/j8w36bk/)

I‚Äôm in a discussion with a community member that I respect very much, yet strangely we do not seem to agree on something. 

Question for the fam:

If Coinbase would start spinning up Rocket Pool minipools instead of regular validators from today on, would this be good, bad or neutral for decentralization?

Please limit the discussion to this question about decentralization only. I don‚Äôt want it to be a value judgement on Rocket Pool. Of course any actor can use it as it is permissionless. This is not a fault of the protocol. Also please don‚Äôt discuss how unlikely or likely it is that Coinbase would do this. It might be very unlikely with all the risks (RPL exposure, regalutory, other). I just want to know if you think my hypothetical question would be good or bad for decentralization

[u/kainzilla](https://reddit.com/u/kainzilla)

You asked me to post my comment in reply to this thread, but I think it might be worth re-writing it suited for some of the answers I see here. I'm going to write this as if the LEB-8 (8 ETH minipools) are in effect, because that is the long term goal. For anyone reading this not familiar with Rocket Pool, the current version of minipools instead has 16 ETH from the minipool operator and 16 ETH taken from the rETH pool. This difference doesn't impact the following statements, with the exception of making the barrier-of-entry lower.

&nbsp;

# Is it good, bad, or neutral for major staking entities to use the Rocket Pool protocol?

**Answer:** I believe the effect on decentralization is neutral, but in spite of that neutral effect from this factor alone I think it would be _actually devastating_ to Ethereum's prospects to shut out large entities, due to runaway centralization behind 2-3 broadly used liquid staking tokens. Here are my thoughts.

&nbsp;

# Important Note: What does Rocket Pool do to help decentralize the network?

1. It lowers the barrier to entry for a solo staker from 32 ETH, down to 8 ETH + a portion of collateral (roughly a 70% reduction in initial capital required).
2. It gives parties interested in acquiring staking services access to a service pool that isn't monopolized by a single entity (it is permissionless).
3. Specifically note that "gives more nodes to smaller stakers" isn't in this list. This will be addressed below.

&nbsp;

# Fallacy 1: Comparing centralized entity Rocket Pool use to centralized entities not using Rocket Pool

* The protocol is permissionless, and you cannot prevent any size staker from using it.
* The permissionless feature is non-negotiable, as otherwise centralization is a factor and the protocol is pointless.
* Desire to deny large entities from using it is pointless, and large entities staking in RP should be considered a likely outcome.
* Are features #1 and #2 outlined above compromised by large entities using the protocol? I believe these features are not compromised.
* With that in mind, the comparison of centralized entities using Rocket Pool vs. not using it results in a net neutral comparison minus a concern addressed in the next section.
* A much more important comparison when thinking about Rocket Pool usefulness is "How does this compare to the situation without any Rocket Pool?"

&nbsp;

# Fallacy 2: Increased node counts for centralized entities using Rocket Pool

Some comments here point to the fact that small stakers can obtain a 4x node power "multiplier" against large staking entities, and that large staking entities entering the picture defeats this purpose. This is a fallacy, however:

* **If you could** engineer a Rocket Pool protocol where you could magically keep out large-entity stakers, you could then tout "increased node counts for small stakers" as a decentralization-increasing feature of Rocket Pool, but that feature would only function up to the number of small node operators you would have available in the pool. Once that pool of small stakers runs out however, no further rETH could be created.
* Any demand for staking services beyond what rETH capacity exists would then likely flow over to centralized staking entities outright. Meaning that they would be spinning up more nodes, _just as if they had spun them up from rETH-provided funds_. It would literally just end up a 1:1 conversion.
* The end result of this hypothetical scenario where you block out large stakers, is that you have lost:
    1. The permissionless feature, and more importantly,
    2. you've seriously handicapped the value your accessible-to-all staking services access pool due to the low ceiling of possible funds, and the fact that you just forced a huge number of customers over to centralized entities providing liquid staking tokens.

&nbsp;

The same scenario effectively plays out if you make the comparison of centralized entities using RP vs. RP not existing:

* In this scenario where Rocket Pool doesn't exist, it's once again a very, _very_ safe assumption that people whom are already comfortable delegating their funds for staking on the network, would instead use centralized services for their staking instead.
* This means that it's safe to assume that all funds flowing into rETH in the centralized-entities RP scenario would instead just be... with those centralized entities you're concerned with.
* Now, in this scenario, there isn't an accessible-to-all staking services market at all, and it's almost 100% guaranteed that one staking service is going to become popular on a runaway level purely due to the convenience of having a single liquid staking token. Lido almost did this on accident purely by being early to market and being able to expand rapidly.

&nbsp;

Considering those two scenarios, node counts for any of these scenarios are **irrelevant and are not a factor in comparing any situation for Rocket Pool**. The fact is, Rocket Pool _will_ actually give a slight node-power advantage to decentralization, but only by virtue of feature #1 - _the reduced barrier-to-entry._ There is no scenario where Rocket Pool increases the amount of power a centralized entity has in comparison to Rocket Pool not existing, or locking centralized entities out.

# The actual strength of Rocket Pool decentralization

So what's the actual strength of Rocket Pool? It's specifically item #2, the accessible-to-all staking services pool. The lowered barrier to entry for actual node-operators at 8 ETH is to be frank pretty awesome and amazing, and it's going to let a lot more people into the ETH staking ecosystem, but the point that people keep missing about the accessible-to-all staking services pool that is provided is that it **keeps the biggest liquid-staking token out of the hands of a single entity**, or at the very least provides a nearly-unstoppable competitor. If Rocket Pool didn't exist, staking-services users would have **nowhere** to send their money except centralizing forces, and what's more is that small operations wouldn't be able to attract staking-services customers for shit - nobody would use little-known liquid-staking tokens, and the small operations would get crushed on margins by the big operations.

Every centralized entity that joins this accessible-to-all pool makes it that much harder for any centralized entity to monopolize the liquid-staking-token market, and even better, the protocol itself isn't really able to use it's own dominance of the liquid-staking market to try and shut out competitors except by trying to provide better service to keep people using rETH - so even competitors will still be able to rise up if they make something truly great. The protocol can't blacklist competing liquid-staking tokens on the protocol's (non-existent) exchange, the protocol can't make back-room deals to give more favorable staking percentages to special, favored customers, the protocol can't lock out small staking providers that the big providers don't like.

Rocket Pool can't actually shut out centralized or large entities by design, and it also shouldn't because doing so is inherently a bad idea. Any centralization of node operators on the Rocket Pool protocol would have existed without Rocket Pool, and if you try and shut them out that money gets transferred _right over to external centralized entities anyways_. Rocket Pool's design has likely averted a scenario where a few major exchanges dominated the entire staking services market on the Ethereum chain, which... to be honest, I think would have truly killed the decentralization angle and left us with little claim to security.

Heads up, I received an unsolicited call this morning allegedly coming from Coinbase support indicating that my account had been logged into from another country and that they were placing a hold on my account. While on the phone they sent me an email confirming this and a text message with a link to hxxps://issue-coinbase.com/email=?[EMAIL] to reset my account. They then gave me an 8 digit password over the phone with which to login.

I pretty much knew from the start that this was bullshit but the hxxps://issue-coinbase.com domain really sealed it. If you get any unsolicited calls from any exchange *please* ignore it, and maybe report it here for educational purposes. Stay safe out there.

> Anyone with an ounce of understanding about economies knows why a DEFLATIONARY currency could never work as the standard.

As the standard for what? Buying eggs and bread? Paying people's salaries? Investing in stuff? Sure. In that case, a deflationary, value-appreciating currency is bad. Thankfully that's not what Ether is.

> We need money to lose value over time to deincentivise people sitting on savings.

The first and foremost job of Ether as an asset is to provide economic security to Ethereum. "Anyone with an ounce of understanding" about that realizes it'd be dumb to devalue this asset on purpose. Ether is collateral money, not debt money. Having the value of your collateral go up gives you more bandwidth to participate in the economy by doing more stuff you otherwise couldn't

> Only when money is used does it lube up the economy by providing cash flow for industry.

Again that's not really Ether's job to do that, but even then it still does it well inside the Ethereum economy: it's deflationary BECAUSE it's being used. "Anyone with an ounce of understanding" quickly realizes this cause and effect relationship and doesn't invert it by claiming being deflationary causes people to not use it.

Ethereum sells blockspace and blockspace accessories. This blockspace is *worth* something, people are willingly paying for it, choosing to burn their precious deflationary ETH in exchange for it. There is no "bad money drives out good" when it comes to buying blockspace, thanks to EIP-1559.

I'm tired of these takes that miss out on all the nuance. "ETH deflation bad because deflation encourages hoarding" is one of them. And yes, "ETH deflation good because supply goes down = line go up" is another one. It's a cringe meme responding to Bitcoin's equally cringe "capped supply = sound money" meme.

The truth is fundamentally, whether the supply goes up or down doesn't affect the velocity of ETH. Whether supply goes up or down, it's all just an accounting trick that doesn't change the fact that value ultimately flows from *users* (paying for blockspace) into the pockets of *holders* (who are likely to be staking, directly or indirectly). You're not magically gonna turn a hoarder into a user if you increase issuance, because that hoarder is already staking anyway.

It's quite a brilliant feature of eip 1559.

If demand for blockspace falls below a certain threshold, ETH issuance goes up while gas prices go down. This has the effect of making it more likely for more people to use ETH, bringing us back to more demand for blockspace.

If demand for blockspace is above a certain threshold, ETH issuance goes ultrasound. More ETH fees are burned instead of given to validators.

If staking becomes extremely desirable, and more and more people stake,  staking rewards APY falls, and the threshold of blockspace demand required for fee burns increases.

If staking becomes less desirable and more and more people unstake, staking APY increases and the threshold for fee burning falls.

It's a completely automated, decentralized monetary policy which favors equilibrium. Nothing else on earth like it.

Ethereum eip 1559 increases incentive to secure the network in a way that avoids inflating the supply, without being 100% reliant on market forces such as gas fees. Unlike Bitcoin security which will eventually become completely enslaved to the wills and fluctuations of the market, and without sufficient fees (blockspace demand) will become more and more centralized and less and less secure.

Very interesting speech just given by Augustin Carstens, the General manager for the BIS. Pay close attention to the last paragraph/bolded text. They totally understand the power of shared ledgers/opensource/composable. They just want to centralize it and own it.

edit: formatting; summarizing a little bc the kicker comes at the end of a wall of text.

&#x200B;

> A unified ledger is a digital infrastructure with the potential to combine the monetary system with other registries of real and financial claims. It would need to be a public-private partnership with a clear division of roles, and where the central bank is tasked with underpinning the trust in money.  
>  
> Like smartphone platforms, a unified ledger allows various components to work seamlessly together. But unlike them, it is enabled by open architecture that promotes financial inclusion and greater competition.  
>  
> Such a ledger allows for the use of smart contracts and composability. A smart contract is a computer program that executes conditional "if/then" and "while" commands. Composability means that many smart contracts, covering multiple transactions and situations, can be bundled together, like "money lego".  
>  
> With these new functionalities, any sequence of transactions in programmable money can be automated and seamlessly integrated. This reduces the need for manual interventions that delay transactions and reduces dependency on intermediaries, and also allows for simultaneous and near-instant payments and settlement.  
>  
> Greater interoperability and automated transfers could ultimately benefit consumers through more convenient and cheaper products that are better tailored to their needs, thereby enhancing financial inclusion.  
>  
> These foreseeable gains may just be the tip of the iceberg of additional transformations. Think about how the smartphone displaced digital cameras. It was not because it takes better pictures, but because it's easier to share these pictures with friends through the same device.  
>  
> **Importantly, programmability and composability do not require decentralised or permissionless platforms. All the potential benefits I just outlined can be achieved in permissioned platforms with various degrees of centralisation.** What really brings the benefits of these projects together is the use of money as a means of payment and settlement. As the provider of the ultimate settlement asset in the economy, the central bank therefore has an important role to play in the governance of a unified ledger. But it would do so in partnership with other public agencies as well as with private sector participants.

<summary>Ecosystem: u/oblvnxknight the one sane person at the SEC seems to have little influence</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10xn2mv/daily_general_discussion_february_9_2023/j7wt9wm/)

The one sane person at the SEC seems to have little influence - she's echoed this sentiment for a few years now and not much has changed. Not a criticism to her, more a comment on the SEC's approach to regulation being firmly entrenched

<https://twitter.com/HesterPeirce/status/1623796583807451139>

Today, the SEC shut down Kraken‚Äôs staking program and counted it as a win for investors. I disagree and therefore dissent.

Kraken operated a service through which its customers could offer their tokens up for staking. The customers earned returns, and the company earned a fee. The Commission argues that this staking program should have been registered with the SEC as a securities offering. Whether one agrees with that analysis or not, the more fundamental question is whether SEC registration would have been possible. In the current climate, crypto-related offerings are not making it through the SEC‚Äôs registration pipeline. An offering like the staking service at issue here raises a host of complicated questions, including whether the staking program as a whole would be registered or whether each token‚Äôs staking program would be separately registered, what the important disclosures what be, and what the accounting implications would be for Kraken.

We have known about crypto staking programs for a long time. Although it may not have made a difference, I should have called for us to put out guidance on staking long before now. Instead of taking the path of thinking through staking programs and issuing guidance, we again chose to speak through an enforcement action, purporting to ‚Äúmake clear to the marketplace that staking-as-a-service providers must register and provide full, fair, and truthful disclosure and investor protection.‚Äù[1] Using enforcement actions to tell people what the law is in an emerging industry is not an efficient or fair way of regulating.[2] Moreover, staking services are not uniform, so one-off enforcement actions and cookie-cutter analysis does not cut it.[3]

Most concerning, though, is that our solution to a registration violation is to shut down entirely a program that has served people well. The program will no longer be available in the United States, and Kraken is enjoined from ever offering a staking service in the United States, registered or not. A paternalistic and lazy regulator settles on a solution like the one in this settlement: do not initiate a public process to develop a workable registration process that provides valuable information to investors, just shut it down.

More transparency around crypto-staking programs like Kraken‚Äôs might well be a good thing. However, whether we need a uniform regulatory solution and if that regulatory solution is best provided by a regulator that is hostile to crypto, in the form of an enforcement action, is less clear.

Not every StackUp quest is worth the effort, but this one seems really easy. It'll walk you through how to use APIs and create a basic web app. The first 3 quests are already up. So far, this one seems pretty basic for anyone who is decently-technical. You don't have to have prior dev knowledge.

<summary>Random: u/busterrulezzz found an interesting mental model to describe the relationship between Ethereum and civil society</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10yhsb2/daily_general_discussion_february_10_2023/j7zb05g/)

This is going to be long, sorry.

I think I've found an interesting mental model to describe the relationship between Ethereum and civil society, especially with respect to the (sometimes) irrational hatred for the protocol.

I believe that as a public good, Ethereum is like a large public transportation project.

Indeed, every Western city that has decided to invest in such projects has faced absolutely incredible opposition. In Bordeaux, France, the tramway project caused protests, arguments, political riff raff - a non-negligible portion of the population swore that they would never use the tramway, because they were opposed to it from the beginning.

Now, two decades later, Bordeaux is a model for major European cities, and the opposition has disappeared. The ridership of the tramway is extraordinary, which suggests that even the most furious opponents have pounded on their pride and are using the service when they need it.

It's the same everywhere. When London wanted to reduce the number of cars in the city center, the anger of the citizens was incredible. Twenty years later, no one would go back. I experienced it personally in Montreal: the current mayor built bike lanes on major commercial arteries, which led opponents to predict the imminent death of downtown. Four years later, the city's liveliest thoroughfares are the ones that received new bike lanes, and absolutely no one is calling for a reversal - even the most rabid opponents.

This got me thinking. Why were these citizens so fiercely opposed to a public good? On what arguments was their opposition based?

I went back and read their open letters and angry tweets. Basically, the opponents were concerned that the loss of parking space would hurt business, create traffic congestion, and make the city ugly (!).

Literally none of this has happened. In fact, the exact opposite has happened. 

Now, let's ask ourselves why these arguments overrode the emotions of the opponents. My theory is that it is a "failure of imagination": an inability to imagine the world differently, to find creative solutions that are outside the current paradigm. They are stuck in the only model they know, and are unable to believe that another world is possible. 

There is also, in my opinion, an element of ego. Many of the opponents were at the top of the social pyramid - wealthy businessmen, popular TV hosts, bourgeois, etc. The world as it is has been extremely generous to them, so why change it? Besides, the idea that a revolution could arise from outside the system that brought them into the world is frightening for them. It means that their privileges are not so solid after all.

I believe Ethereum is in a similar situation.

Our protocol is a public good. It belongs to its participants, and literally any human being can deploy an application on it. This is an absolutely revolutionary idea from the outside - have you seen what Vitalik looks like? It's impossible that a nerd like that, with no credibility in high society, has come up with something good. So his creation is necessarily a fraud, which must be fought

So these opinion leaders declare Ethereum an enemy to be fought, and the citizens used to following what the top of the pyramid tells them jump on the bandwagon, without asking themselves if their fight is really relevant.

TL;DR : Ethereum will (hopefully) follow the same trajectory as public transit projects.

<summary>Ecosystem: u/mgr37 explains the use of the validator mnemonic after the withdrawal address is set</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1108k4a/daily_general_discussion_february_12_2023/j88acu5/)

Good question !

As I understand it, yes the seed will no longer be useful for normal operation:

- once withdrawal address set, it can't be changed
- partial withdrawal will be automated to the withdrawal address.
- exit is triggered with validator keys (the one used to run the validator client) and actual full withdrawal will be automated to the withdrawal address.


BUT you would still need it for:

- derivating new validator keys from the same seed (not compulsory, you could use a new seed for new validators, but might be handy -> see next point)
- re-generate your validator keys in case they got lost (i.e. staking rig hard drive crash). I think that's the main reason to keep the seed (and use the same seed when rolling new validators). 
You could backup the keys instead but it's easier to keep a seed backup than keys backup IMO.

<summary>Ecosystem: u/Blueberry314E-2 does some research on the SEC vs BUSD</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1111020/daily_general_discussion_february_13_2023/j8euz36/)

Some of my own research on SEC vs BUSD:

The New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) has told Paxos to stop making its own version of BUSD (a digital currency) "as a result of several unresolved issues related to Paxos‚Äô oversight of its relationship with Binance in regard to Paxos-issued BUSD."

Paxos‚Äô BUSD product is **related to, but separate from**, Binance‚Äôs self-issued *Binance-pegged BUSD*. Binance‚Äôs *self-issued BUSD*, which is not directly regulated by NYDFS, **is independently wrapped and issued by the crypto exchange on blockchains beyond Ethereum**. In other words, Binance can take a single Paxos-issued BUSD, create an *analogous BUSD* on another blockchain (like Binance‚Äôs own blockchain, for example), and freeze a corresponding Paxos-issued BUSD. ‚ÄúThe Department has not authorized *Binance-Peg BUSD* on any blockchain, and *Binance-Peg BUSD* is not issued by Paxos."

So the issue here is not 'true' BUSD issued by Paxos. The problem is that Binance was sneakily issuing alternative *unregulated BUSD* on it's own blockchain and others, and passing them off as the real, regulated, Ethereum based BUSD issued by Paxos.

Paxos has told its customers that it will end its relationship with Binance for BUSD. The DFS is watching Paxos closely to make sure it can handle redemptions properly, following new safety rules. **It's important to know that Paxos was allowed to make BUSD on the Ethereum blockchain, but** ***Binance-Peg BUSD*** **is not approved or made by Paxos.** There are no restrictions from the DFS for New York companies to list or trade the existing Paxos-issued BUSD.

Looks to me like Binance is to blame here, SEC is just trying to clean up their mess.

<summary>Random: u/Lazy_Physicist has a cool idea for once Stakewise V3 launches</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/111vdwx/daily_general_discussion_february_14_2023/j8kik5e/)

Regulatory news aside, I've just had a thought. Stakewise v3 would allow node operators to set up vaults with whitelisted addresses for allocators. This in theory allows us to set up vaults where only holders of EVMavericks/EIPandas/etc. are allowed to deposit ETH into. I'm sure there are others here like myself who have overallocated on the hardware for our own staking rigs or have extra bandwidth. If I were to use swise I would probably set up multiple vaults if I didn't have to provide any collateral to do so. A vault or two to stake for "members" who can't or won't solo stake free of commission, then however many public vaults I want to run with a commission. This could be an interesting way for communities to drive value to their NFT Collections.


Edit: SWISE staking taking a share of the fees will probably factor into how feasible this is

<summary>Community: u/cheeky-gorilla reports back from the Edelweiss Interop Workshop</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10rigcl/daily_general_discussion_february_2_2023/j6wdzn9/)

By now you've probably heard that last week was the [Edelweiss Interop Workshop](https://twitter.com/peter_szilagyi/status/1620095331252981760) (the successor to the [Amphora Interop](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/10/15/amphora-merge-milestone)), where Ethereum's core devs spent a week together in the mountains to work on withdrawals, 4844 (aka proto-danksharding) and EOF.

I was invited to join due to my work on the [Protocol Guild](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and - even though it still feels like a dream - I wanted to share my experience, especially as someone without a technical background.

Was the workshop a success? Absolutely. To quote a core dev, "we left with a flawless Capella/Shanghai fork", and there was a 4844 testnet with all but one client team! 4844 in July? üëÄ

I'll admit I was INCREDIBLY nervous going into this event, I couldn't sleep properly for days in advance - I was literally going to meet the majority of my heroes, and I was 100% going to be the dumbest person in the room at all times.

Well, I can happily confirm that "you should never meet your heroes" does NOT apply to Ethereum's core protocol contributors. These are some of the most interesting (and surprisingly funny) people I've ever met, and even though there was [a lack of diversity](https://twitter.com/trent_vanepps/status/1620438540328005633), they came from all over the world, with all sorts of different backgrounds. And despite the fact that the price of ETH is never discussed on ACD calls, I can confirm that Ethereum's core devs are bullish: I heard more than one conversation about [ultra sound money](https://ultrasound.money/), and [RatioGang](https://ratiogang.com/) was also strongly represented! I'm an introvert, but everyone was so incredibly welcoming and kind, I never had any issues talking to people.

Overall, the passion these individuals have for Ethereum is genuine and contagious, and I feel more confident than ever in Ethereum's ability to execute its [roadmap](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1588669782471368704) while staying aligned to its values of decentralization, openness and long-term thinking.

Other highlights included organizing a core dev run one morning, and as a pretty hardcore privacy enthusiast, I even had the pleasure of giving privacy tips to Vitalik! Oh and there was that one time that Danny Ryan wasn't allowed at dinner because he was wearing flip flops üòõ

I'll end with one note of encouragement for those who need it: if I can end up at this kind of event, then so can you. To quote Danny Ryan, "doors are wide open at Ethereum". My "door" was the Protocol Guild booth at Devcon Bogota, where I asked Trent and Tim if they needed any operational help with the Guild, and turns out they did! (For the introverts, I passed by the booth 3-4 times before I gathered up the nerve to talk to them - don't let shyness gatekeep your passions!). Now I spend my time coordinating / helping with the Guild's [v2 architecture](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/5-initial-pilot.html#v2-architecture) upgrade, fundraising and marketing, all without a technical background.

This comment is already much longer than I expected, so I'll end it here. TLDR: everything good about Ethereum is reflected in its core devs, and the barriers to entry are probably lower than you think!

<summary>Ecosystem: u/Canadiens1993 thinks that US tax laws are inhibiting solo staking</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10scsic/daily_general_discussion_february_3_2023/j730mpx/)

**Unclear Tax Treatment for Staking (USA):  Centralization Vector?**

Let me explain.  Retail has a choice:

\- Staking on, say, Coinbase and it prepares and sends you the requisite tax form every year.  You forego a small percentage of your staking rewards in exchange for this service, and you must  entrust your ETH with a regulated custodian (centralization risk); or

\- per current IRS position, solo stakers must record revenue for each attestation (every 6 min), for each block produced (random) and tips/MEV (random).  There is a valid legal argument for staking rewards to be taxed when sold (not when received), but the IRS has dismissed it - [https://www.proofofstakealliance.org/12423-posa-response-to-irs-stance-on-staking](https://www.proofofstakealliance.org/12423-posa-response-to-irs-stance-on-staking). So what does this mean in practice.

1. **Taxable income**: Setting aside how to deal with Shanghai and managing price volatility given the queue for withdrawals, you'll need to record revenue every 6min for the ETH received as taxable income (currently: 13329 GWei) at the value on the date/time "received"; and then (and this is where I lose my shit);
2. **Capital Gain/Loss Tax**: if and when you sell ETH in the future you will need to record a capital gain/loss using the cost basis above for that petty 13329 GWei received.  You will never be selling only 13329 GWei.

If you think I just made the case for LSDs, then you understand the problem.  Maybe this can easily fixed with more sophisticated tax software?    **WE NEED TO LOBBY FOR A CHANGE IN THE IRS's TREATMENT OF STAKING REWARDS FOR SOLO STAKERS.**

*Note: I'm not a member of the PoS Alliance and not a tax lawyer or CPA, just a random dude who pays his taxes and truly believes in decentralization and the transformational potential of the Ethereum network.*

<summary>Ecosystem: u/vvpan quells our expectations on the current state of rollups and their future development timeline</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10t6kdg/daily_general_discussion_february_4_2023/j79lvy8/)

I've been known to come off kind of negative about the state of roll-ups. I do think that long-term they are the absolute best way to scale blockchains. Justin Drake the other day blew the minds of all participants of Bankless Bullcase for Ethereum by saying that the synchronous composability between zk rollups is such that different different rollups can combine their liquidity into a single pool and that Danksharding does not break that composability. Yet the key is *long-term.* Optimism, the oldest optimistic rollup, has not yet gotten to fraud proofs and neither has Arbitrum. And ZK is a much much more complex technology that requires highly skilled mathematically skilled developers to implement and will roll out slower at least because there is much more potential for bugs (although Justin Drake said Ethereum research team recently figured out how to add "training wheels" to a rollup). I think [this tweet](https://twitter.com/Scroll_ZKP/status/1621573597566468096) from Scroll zkEVM account is telling about where we are.  
I am not saying this to be a downer, but to say that we have to have realistic expectations. Big announcements for "mainnet" of this or that rollup or some new improvement to one are galore and sometimes I feel like they are borderline disingenuous. I understand their teams - they reach significant personal milestones and they want to share. But a secure decentralized general-puprose rollup of any kind seems to be behind the horizon for now.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10u5d4l/daily_general_discussion_february_5_2023/j7aqft0/)

Hey fellas, wanted to share something we put together recently at defi saver - a dedicated page for various leveraged ETH staking options that you can check out at: [https://app.defisaver.com/recipes/leveraged-staking](https://app.defisaver.com/recipes/leveraged-staking)

We added support for both Aave v3 and the new WETH-based deployment of Compound v3 in the past two weeks and both offered new interesting options for leveraging LSDs vs ETH for amplified staking yield, so we thought this made sense.

For now you can find different (w)stETH/ETH options across Aave v2, v3 and CompV3-WETH in there, as well as the cbETH/ETH combo available in Compound (which is at net negative yield atm because of high pool utilisation).

Next: we'll have a new Morpho-Aave integration live, and after that we expect to see rETH added to Aave v3 on the mainnet \*and\* wstETH added to Aave v3 on Optimism. So you can definitely expect to see a growing number of options there in the coming weeks and months.

Btw, if you check it out, we'd love to hear what else we could add, so please don't hesitate. I also posted an alternative rundown on this on [twitter](https://twitter.com/_nikolajankovic/status/1622183165098971136) / [nitter](https://nitter.net/_nikolajankovic/status/1622183165098971136) (nitter isn't loading this for me atm, did twitter already kill it? :/)

<summary>Random: u/theethmeister The current moment feels like we are caught in a wave of uncertainty</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10woz0p/daily_general_discussion_february_8_2023/j7omifz/)

I hope everyone has a great day. The current moment feels like we are caught in a wave of uncertainty due to economic and political constraints and factors but that does not mean you should lose faith in the premise of a decentralized monetary system or this community. 

The doldrums of the crab should not deter you from your belief that ETH  is the best technological investment at this time. This can obviously change in the future due to a new cryptocurrency/blockchain displacing ETH or quantum technology rendering our keys worthless. However it is my belief we are still on the ground floor of an emerging asset class. I remember when I used to tell my school friends to connect with me online but they didn't even have internet access because they were lacking dial up modems on their Windows 95 desktops. I found so many great communities online and made a great many number of friends on the "world wide web" before it became so commonplace as it is now. In the end I honestly do not know if the internet has been a net positive in light of the harmful effects of social media and the ease of scamming.

Sorry for the rambling, but my point is Ethereum and Ethfinance remind me of those mid to late 90s internet moments, which leads me to think that $10k USD is a ridiculously low valuation after withdrawals are enabled. The current period is in the Web 1 phase (Angelfire, Xanga, Yahoo Mail) and not even comparable to Web 2.0. We need some hopium so I am going to prognosticate a low of $15k USD in 2025. Buy now and sell never.

The concept of the ‚Äúcarbon footprint‚Äù was the brainchild of an advertising firm working for BP.

Same bucket as recycling trash that goes into the same land fills as general waste.

More important things to focus on individually, sorry for the jaded take.

<summary>OPSEC: u/RooftopPortaPotty investigates the scam that took out a fellow EthFinancier</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10lkzyb/daily_general_discussion_january_26_2023/j5yw3vm/)

Today we will be investigating the scam that took advantage of our friend who came here looking for help yesterday. My inital intent was to remove this campaign from the internet.

Though, as my investigation progressed, I became more and more conscious of the CFAA. I would not discourage anyone who understands the implications from picking up where I left off.

**The Scam**

Loading the domain in your browser will instantly prompt MetaMask to connect. Doing so leads to a fake DEX. You are given a 6 digit ‚ÄòID‚Äô that is displayed on the front page. Below is an example of one of their scam pages.

<https://imgur.com/Wy5NPSb>

This is all over the place. USDT-ERC20, output in ETC. They provide various addresses to deposit your funds. At least one of the addresses provided does not even have an ETH balance ‚Äì without any gas money, these fraudsters were never planning to return any deposits.

I clicked on the button that was a head with headphones, presumably the support button.

<https://imgur.com/s2V6PAW>

You can ‚ÄòEmall‚Äô them at the displayed email address. Visiting the above domain in chrome showed the exact same front end as the scam we‚Äôre dealing with.

Frighteningly, they want you to ‚Äòauthenticate‚Äô.

<https://imgur.com/B9nXvHN>

They ask for your name and email address. Infinitely worse, they want pictures of any forms of your identification, as can be seen below.

<https://imgur.com/iJpMGIj>

Anyone who has completed this form should consider their identity stolen, and contact the appropriate authorities.

**Offense**

To begin to gain some understanding of a website, using ‚Äòview page source‚Äô in your browser is an extremely effective tool.

<https://imgur.com/8q39ows>

The highlighted text is Simplified Chinese for ‚Äòpage loaded‚Äô. *Quite* interesting.

As an attacker, this file upload form offers a massive attack surface. Of course, an experienced intruder knows what to do here.

But for any ethfinanciers who would like to learn more about this, here are some resources [1](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload)[2](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Unrestricted_File_Upload)[3](https://www.aptive.co.uk/blog/unrestricted-file-upload-testing/) or just ask ya boi.

When running a [black box](https://brightsec.com/blog/black-box-penetration-testing/) web application security test, /robots.txt is a critical file to access. This file is used by servers to request that web crawlers such as google not access/archive the list of URLs within the file.

As you might imagine, these often times contain URLs of relative importance. Whether crawlers choose to obey is completely up to them both technically, and legally(not legal advice).

The requested /robots.txt did not directly return any confidential files or directories. Though, it resulted in a fairly signficant information leak.

<https://imgur.com/eJwEEWq>

I unfortunately did not think to translate that Chinese text to English. Do we have any Chinese speaking ethfinanciers who can help out?

Notice that this error leaks a number of file paths on this server.

At the bottom we see that the server uses ThinkPHP 3.2.0, which happens to be vulnerable to a high severity issue.

<https://imgur.com/3l8C9Tf>

I will not fix the URL provided in the description to fit this target simply for the safety of those who do not know exactly what they‚Äôre doing. Be very careful before landing yourself in federal prison.

When learning to attack a system, one thing that has to be reinforced is the idea of enumeration. I cannot find a link to an article that accurately articulates what I wish to convey. I would describe it is as the art of testing ideas, taking notes of oddities, and learning everything you can about your target system.

Here‚Äôs an example. Screenshots were not taken, but I found that files requested that lack the the extension ‚Äò.php‚Äô resulted in the same error shown in /robots.txt. Is it a vulnerability? No. Is it worth noting if you wish to gain a thorough understanding of your target? Yes.

I've seen *lots* of examples of security researchers bringing down scam websites without facing prosecution, but a number of things made me hesitant in this case.

<https://imgur.com/0j1UzE0>

The true ip address of the scammers is protected by Cloudflare. Finding the ip address of servers behind Cloudflare is an eternal challenge for attackers.

<https://scrapeops.io/web-scraping-playbook/how-to-bypass-cloudflare/> seems to be extremely comprehensive and up to date. I tried every technqiue short of signing up for a service that requires an API key. No results, the following provides a fair explanation for that.

<https://imgur.com/iK54QDk>

As [/u/REALJohnBMacLemore](https://reddit.com/u/REALJohnBMacLemore) previously noted, the website was only created a few months ago. Thats always suspicious. What about the domain listed as the support email address?

<https://imgur.com/4xC20qD>

This domain is hosted by Alibaba US. That they dont even provide an abuse contact speaks volumes.

In my brief enumeration efforts, I visisted /index.php, which redirected me to /Pc/Index/index.html.

<https://imgur.com/DDUUiAQ>

The HTML does not render properly, but this is completely different than what we were dealing with before.

<https://imgur.com/wk227MG>

At the bottom of the page we see another support email address. The highlighted text seems to show that the listed website(NOTE: not the scam domain in question) might have been a real company at some point? The registration number certainly does not comply with the new Chinese business registration numbering system, which was in full effect by 2018.

Lets use <https://whois.domaintools.com> again to find some information about this newly discovered forex exchange domain.

<https://imgur.com/2o6PP1v>

The domain name has been used for at least 16 years.

This scam seems to be masquerading as a possibly real, but defunct Chinese forex exchange. Also doubling as a crypto exchange, depending on their target.

[Attribution](https://www.exabeam.com/incident-response/cyber-attribution-essential-component-of-incident-response-or-optional-extra/) has always been a touchy subject in the realm of cyber security, with that type of debate usually reserved for large-scale nation state attacks.

When we consider the prevalent usage of the Simplified Chinese language, a Chinese PHP framework, and Alibaba hosting, Im confident in declaring this a campaign of Chinese origin. Of course, given the lack of sophistication on the part of the scammers, and the lack of geopolitical implications, this is virtually meaningless.

Stay safe, RTPP

<summary>Community: u/DoubtStarsAreFire shares her and Logris's back story</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10n7qyq/daily_general_discussion_january_28_2023/j67f4fp/)

For those of you that are regular readers of Logris‚Äô work and do not know, Logris and I (DoubtStarsAreFire) run *Tokenomics Explained* together. We are partners in all things. Family, life, the website, and now our consulting business. In the beginning, I would minimize, qualify, and categorize all of the work that we have put into our site as, ‚Äúoh we run a blog‚Äù. Probably because when we started *Tokenomics Explained* we didn‚Äôt have a plan. Increasingly, we do, or at least ambition.

# EV Mavericks Podcast:

Listen to the [Layer Zero Podcast #4](https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/VX3ZGDe6Qwb) from the EV Mavericks to hear us talk more about *Tokenomics Explained*, Hodlercon, the Double Logris and our plans for Logris Vaults! Ping us if you'd like to join our BUIDL team at EthDenver.

I felt like we could do a better job explaining the genesis of the blog. Because if you listen we kind of stumble over the answer.

Why am I posting now? The blog has mainly been a space for Logris‚Äô writing. The main reason that I‚Äôm posting is I joined the Bankless Academy writers guild. I‚Äôll be posting content on the website for the next four weeks. I'm calling these contributions Stargazing. There were other options for locations to post my thoughts like Mirror or Medium. I really did think about posting there. But, our blog seemed like the best place. Stargazing will be my additions to ‚ÄúLogris the Blog‚Äù.

Visit [https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-story-of-tokenomics-explained/](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-story-of-tokenomics-explained/) to see the whole post.

*Below is a short excerpt.*

# The Backstory

I‚Äôve always heard it said, ‚Äúwrite what you know‚Äù so for a first topic answering the question ‚ÄúHow did Tokenomics Explained start?‚Äù seems appropriate. Logris and I have been asked this exact question several times in interviews or by friends. That is usually a good sign you should write something down.

First, at heart my husband is a writer. When I met him, it wasn‚Äôt something I knew about him. I just thought he was a cute programmer boy that I was meeting to play board games. It‚Äôs taken years for me to come to the realization that he is a writer as well a programmer. I‚Äôm starting here because it gets to the heart of why we began this venture. He became interested in crypto because it combined his interests of computer science, game theory, and economics. Just like you should write about what you know, you should invest in what you know. Back in 2017, most of the social media about crypto was on reddit. This eventually led him to ethtrader and from there to ethfinance. Me, I was along for the ride. He would talk at me about crypto and I would blink at him and say, ‚Äúthose were words‚Äù.

I watched him ride the bull market of 2017 and then the crash. He survived the crypto winter. Eventually the food coin craze hit. All the while, Logris was riding the waves and I was following along or lurking in reddit parlance. Based on my experience and observations in my own house, I thought everyone was spending hours reading, researching, and writing their posts. Over the years, I have learned differently. Thank you reddit shit posters for disabusing me of this notion.

So why did we choose to make a website? In short, it‚Äôs Google‚Äôs fault. Ever since Logris started investing in crypto in 2017, he was a daily visitor and poster to the subreddit. As you know, all the fun in ethfinance takes place in the Daily Discussion Thread. Over the years Logris had made some stellar posts‚Ä¶ in the daily. But, Google doesn‚Äôt index the daily. Top level posts are often reserved for announcements from protocols, highly regarded posts from the daily, or noobs that don‚Äôt know any better.

Why is this important to the story?

TLDR: It‚Äôs all because of Google‚Äôs SEO.

>**For example:** At some point in the past, you may have googled about a question you had. In the search results, there may have been a reddit post with the same question. You'd click the link and find yourself directed to a subreddit about the topic, where knowledgeable people may have already responded to your exact or similar question.

**Since most of the posts on ethfinance happen in the daily thread and not at the top level** (as in the example), **this content is invisible to Google.**

Logris was amassing a treasure trove of content and often wanted to cite it when it became relevant again. This became more pertinent when he came up with the idea for the Double Logris. People started asking about it and wanting to read more about it. His ideas, content, and discussions were disappearing into the ether as it were. So, he started using Google drive to keep track for referral, which was ridiculous. To save time and just generally make the world a better place we decided to create a repository for his writings by making this site.

<summary>Analysis: u/Defacticool just finished studying law and discusses how DAOs fit in existing legal framework</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10o0h5d/daily_general_discussion_january_29_2023/j6dqs2n/)

Hope this is an acceptable place to ask some questions both for the mods and regulars here. 

Last spring I graduated from law school (here in sweden, my degree is an analogue to an LMM) and I wrote my "final paper" on DAO and defi, from a company law and securities law perspective. 

I recently saw and read that paper from /u/Pbrody (hope that's correct) and EY about how the "best" firm classification for DAO's are as Co-operatives. 

And so I thought maybe there would be some interest to see my own research that I spent 6 months on. (Tldr of my conclusion: "Proper" DAOs don't fit any current, swedish, firm classifications and are unable to fit in one even if they wanted to, and securities law is unable to in any way sanction or interactive with fully autonomous swapping protocols such as Uniswap)

So my questions are: 

- Would there be any interest if I posted my paper here? 
- would the mods be alright with me posting it here?
- and finally, does anyone know of a good and accessible site where I could upload my paper and those interested could read/download it? Preferably one where I don't have to dox myself. 

Cheers! I Love this community.

Edit: Thought I should add, I wrote it in english.

Editwo: Just posted it in today's daily: https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10oudh1/daily_general_discussion_january_30_2023/j6iwia0/

In yesterday's daily I asked about interest for sharing my "final exam paper" from when I graduated law school last year. (After looking into it further, I believe the american term for it is something like "masters research paper") 

I got way greater of a response than I anticipated so I'll be sharing it with you in this comment! I hope a mediafire link is allowed. 

Just some heads up that the version I'm linking you isn't the final handed-in version but the penultimate version so there will be some grammatical and spelling errors but nothing that should affect the content. This is so I don't run afoul of any academic policies about sharing examinated material through the wrong channels. (Should be fine, but don't wanna risk it) 

<https://www.mediafire.com/file/tyd530ryrjljst2/DAO_and_DEFI_legal_analysis.pdf/file>

If anyone has any constructive thoughts I genuinely would love to hear them! 

In a comment in response to this one I'll be posting the "Final Remarks" portion, for those that just wants my final take and don't care to trudge through the rest.

<summary>Random: u/LogrisTheBard discusses the crypto education gap</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10pqbiw/daily_general_discussion_january_31_2023/j6ly502/)

So my wife is working on a post this week on web3 education. On that topic I observe there is a labor to impact mismatch between how web3 education functions today. I see too many tutorials on the basics. Each org like BlueDAO, Bankless Academy, CollectiveShift, BoysClub, etc has their own curriculum. Some of it is even pay gated. It's a lot of replicated effort and unless it's paired with a way of access people outside our ecosystem it's having no impact. On the other end there's highly technical documents on exactly how the Beacon Chain works or the scaling strategy for Ethereum or frontier takes like /u/liberosist writes. These are written for the *dozens* of us living at the edge of the frontier. In the middle is a desert of content. Once you get past that entry level content you get chucked into places like /r/cryptocurrency and good luck to you. You're excited by the potential of what you learnt in the entry level content but you're not yet proficient enough to spot the scams. Everyone is passionately shilling you something and telling you why it's the next great thing that's going to kill Ethereum etc. Basically, you're someone else's exit liquidity.

It takes a full market cycle to wisen up. By the time you transition from tourist to settler you've probably lost 90% of your investment into altcoins. Many don't stick around after that and those who leave form a moat of resentment in front of the Rabbit Hole. The abrupt cliff of learning material once you have a Metamask wallet loaded with some ETH is doing a disservice to our space. It's suddenly a space with no map and no Sherpa and you weren't taught spelunking. It's ultimately discouraging people from joining this space and slowing down the adoption of one of the most promising technologies humanity has ever produced.

In the last year I've written a bit more for this entry +1 skill level and a bit less on the frontier but anything I write tends to come off more as entry +3 regardless of my intent or else I don't find it interesting enough to write. My wife is better than me in this regard so I hope web3 does find a space for her to be an educator here. Anything else is a disservice to *humanity*.

<summary>Random: u/Liberosist is cautious not to get overly bullish about long-term ETH issuance trends</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10qm414/daily_general_discussion_february_1_2023/j6r7sq6/)

As [u/15kisFUD](https://reddit.com/u/15kisFUD) [pointed out](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10pqbiw/comment/j6m5xo7/), the sentiment currently is neutral-ish, so it's a good time to talk about things that everyone will laugh at in bull times or be depressed over in bear times. Now, both u/No_Fix_1183 and I got a ton of backlash (or as NoFix says, "[got crucified](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10pqbiw/comment/j6q5foj/)") over the last couple of days for broaching the inevitability of secular bear market for emerging markets, and how they typically happen on narratives years before actual adoption - but there's at least a few people now who are still interested. No one will listen when the bull comes around, so this is our chance. So, I wanted to take the opportunity to talk about a different topic.

When the ponzis spin back up and the mania happens, the ultrasoundmoney cult will be unbearably loud and you'll see all sorts of absurd projections around the burn, deflation and such. Some of you may remember I was skeptical of the numbers being thrown around in 2021 (having myself fallen for them earlier in 2020) - and even had a little debate with Justin Drake here. It may seem absurd now, but numbers like 20%-70% staking APR, 5% deflation were widely accepted, based off clearly unsustainable usage.

Instead, it would be prudent to form a base case now, and use those numbers instead in the future. The first observation you'll see that in ETH terms, total transaction fees outside of manias are [actually relatively constant](https://etherscan.io/chart/transactionfee) \- which is a big narrative violation of the up-only rhetoric you saw in 2021 and will see again in the next bull. (Yes, the mechanisms have changed since EIP-1559, but it's in the same order of magnitude) \[PS, edit: other data sources like Coin Metrics do account for EIP-1559; however, as I mentioned originally, it's in the same order of magnitude\] The $ tx fees are still going up, of course, with a larger economy and higher ETH price. But remember - burn rates, staking rates, MEV are all denominated in ETH, so it doesn't matter.

It's very likely the type of fees in 2020 (when it peaked) and 2021 will never be seen again - for the simple fact that there's orders of magnitude more blockspace available across L2s and alt-L1s - and even more coming with EIP-4844. Nevertheless, the "premium" ponzis and "luxury" status symbol type NFTs will always be on L1 - so we'll definitely see huge increases in gas prices.

Anyway, getting back to the base case, and what actual sustainable revenue looks like - as mentioned above, it has been relative constant over the years. This comes with the implication that, actually, staking rewards are going to be relatively constant - in the \~1.5%-2.5% range for priority fees + \~1% range for MEV. Meanwhile, issuance is going to reduce over time, so we can safely conclude the long-term staking rewards are going to be somewhere in the \~5% range. Coincidentally, at current staking rate, we should expect very mild deflation, but as more is staked this will revert back to mild inflation.

Now, some will argue "but there are whole new usecases that will come online". Sure, and fees will go up over time in $ times, but as 7 years of data suggests, not in ETH terms. Also, as mentioned above, there's orders of magnitude more space available on L2s going forward, who will pay relatively negligible fees to L1 post EIP-4844 as there'll be a dedicated data fee market. So why won't L1 fees collapse? Because L1 will remain the premiere execution layer - even the perfect L2 won't be quite as secure and Lindy, and the venue for high-value settlements for the foreseeable future.

Tl;dr: staking rewards are likely going to remain the \~5% APR range long term and inflation will probably tend towards being mildly positive, so when you see absurd projections based on unsustainable mania burns during the bull - remain resolute and sell your ETH to those who are aping in thinking 10%-20% yields and 2% deflation is sustainable.

My final "do it while neutral sentiment lasts" rant - I've used the phrase "markets are forward-looking" often. Based on the backlash I've received in the last few days, I sense that people misunderstand it as meaning "investors can predict the future". It's kind of the opposite - in the bull market people will price in a utopia that may be years away; likewise in a bear market people will price in the doom. We have seen this multiple times in crypto. But what we (arguably) haven't seen is a secular peak where the wider market with a majority of institutions/HNWIs will price in a mature Ethereum 5-10 years from now. It's very wrong to think ETH price is up-only until "Ethereum's vision is delivered and there is mass adoption" - markets have never worked like that, especially emerging markets. There are countless examples to look at with very few exceptions - but the most obvious and relevant one to study is, of course, the dot-com bubble. They priced in the final form of the internet way back in 2000, which took till the 2010s to actually deliver - and yes, many internet companies took 10 years to revisit their 2000 highs. Now, some will argue that Ethereum is not a company - but that doesn't matter, ETH's value is derived by market forces, and crypto markets follow the same behaviour.

<summary>Community: u/alexiskef has an ELI5 for the Ethereum KZG ceremony</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10fu4px/daily_general_discussion_january_19_2023/j4zrfmk/)

Hey friends! As you might have noticed from the many comment threads these past 2-3 days, the Ethereum Foundation has been running (since the beginning of this week and for approximately two more months) something called the [KZG Ceremony](https://ceremony.ethereum.org/). 

**MY** noob-friendly eli5 is that this super-easy-to-participate and open-to-everyone ceremony will contribute (via super-fancy-behind-the-scene math) the necessary randomness for the trust assumptions of the upcoming EIP4844, aka ProtoDanksharding.

(The official explanation is: "*This ceremony, sometimes called a "Trusted Setup", will generate a structured reference string (SRS) which is needed for the commitments to work. An SRS is secure as long as at least one participant in the ceremony successfully conceals their secret.")*

The website of the Ceremony has plenty of information on all things ceremony, however, I wanted to share with you all an üéßüî• [excellent podcast episode](https://epicenter.tv/episodes/478) üî•üéß with a conversation between Carl Beekhuizen & Trenton Van Epps from the Ethereum Foundation and the host of [Epicenter.tv](https://Epicenter.tv), Friederike Ernst.

The topics the three of them touch on, are:

* Danksharding and scaling Ethereum
* Data BLOBs and data availability
* KZG ceremony
* How trusted setups evolved
* KZG commitment requirements
* How trust is ensured
* Combining randomness
* How storing secrets is prevented
* General contribution details
* Special contributions
* Quantum vulnerability
* General EIP-4844 timeline

I certainly do not understand 99% of the math, but this conversation really helped me understand the basic ideas behind the whole process! Enjoy!

<summary>Random: u/Bob-Rossi is familiarizing themselves with Linux for the start of their staking journey</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10gp4if/daily_general_discussion_january_20_2023/j56ezbm/)

Public accountability update on my staking journey w/ u/benido2030

After an appreciated pep-talk last week, I took a few hours this week to continue to familiarize myself with Linux. Namely the terminal - found a random YouTube video to just follow along with and type through some basic commands. I think this has been helpful so far because my first attempt at all this I just jumped into a staking guide with literal zero understanding what was going on with the terminal. It was an unnecessary stressor knowing one deviation from a guide and I'm screwed.

I am hoping to get a little more familiar with Linux in general before I go further. So if anyone has ideas / videos of things that helped them when they were starting I'd love to see them. I noticed the [CoinCashew Guide](https://www.coincashew.com/coins/overview-eth/guide-or-how-to-setup-a-validator-on-eth2-mainnet/part-i-installation/guide-or-security-best-practices-for-a-eth2-validator-beaconchain-node) has a lot of security best practice type things I need to familiar myself with, so may start focusing on that stuff. 

If anyone cares (and to in general share back links myself) someone here gave me this link (sorry, it was awhile ago) --- [https://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php](https://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php) --- which was a nice starter read and this was the video I followed along with --- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3ii48qYBxA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3ii48qYBxA) --- which had a lot of similiar stuff but was easy to follow in video. Both super basic, but I can't stress enough how much of a newbie I am with Linux... so it was a comfy start. 

I'd also like to keep this quasi-weekly thing going, so if anyone else is trying going down their staking journey feel free to jump in.

<summary>Analysis: u/LogrisTheBard discusses NFT tickets</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10icjgc/daily_general_discussion_january_22_2023/j5fm373/)

I think the form of NFTs ripe for the next bull cycle will be different. Just as web2 innovated on web1 by adding interactivity, I think we‚Äôll see the same occur for the next wave of NFT‚Äôs. Gone will be the hype for profile pictures and we'll transition towards NFTs with steady demand and which produce revenue streams.

I don't think the infrastructure will be there next bull market for real world asset NFTs like car or house deeds. Governments already have systems for those and even if it would reduce their costs that isn't a metric they are optimizing for. So, I'm looking at informatic use cases of the blockchain that can remain in the digital realm to the point of delivery.

Chief among these are live events or NFT ticketing. Live events occur on a regular basis and the total addressable market cap here makes the art market blush. I particularly like this use case because it serves everyone better except the existing parasitic middlemen.

Just from a technical feature perspective, NFTs provide a provenance trail. If you gate NFT transfers to KYC'd customers then the venues which switch to this system can actually know who attended their events. This is obviously useful information which is lost now and it enables entirely new pathways to engagement between performers and attendees. For example there could be exclusive ticket sale rounds to whitelisted addresses based on previous event attendance.

Additionally there are trust and corruption issues with current ticketing approaches such as corrupt release mechanisms and opaque service charge fees. At the very least having the sale logic on the blockchain can add transparency and equal access to the process. Protocols like POAP and Funfair have already demonstrated provably fair lottery mechanisms when demand outstrips supply. Alternatively more market-like initial auction systems have been demonstrated by newer tokens like Gearbox which used [0xCider](https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/gip-31-1-gear-strategy-cider-ed-liquidity/2050/87). Blockchains are demonstrably excellent at executing a provably fair, transparent process.

As to fees, a lot of the service fee charged by Ticketmaster actually goes to [middlemen or the venue](https://thehustle.co/the-sneaky-economics-of-ticketmaster/). It's how they were able to grow to their current size: they stopped treating the attendee as the customer. There is a market opportunity here to reduce Ticketmaster's cut of the fees though. That is still substantial. Ticketmaster's revenue was [$12.3B in 2022](https://www.economicliberties.us/press-release/live-nation-ticketmasters-record-earnings-come-at-the-expense-of-fans-artists-and-venue-owners/). It's a rather perfect opportunity for some Defi mullet and we're already seeing it start to happen even from Ticketmaster themselves[[1]](https://nbatopshot.com/nba-allstar-vip-pass)[[2]](https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-to-sell-nft-tickets-for-major-italian-soccer-club-lazio/)[[3]](https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/31/ticketmaster-taps-the-flow-blockchain-to-let-event-organizers-issue-nfts-tied-to-tickets/). This is where things like Rarible's multi-chain protocol would really shine as it is fully indexed and is made to allow numerous frontends, dial their own parameters, and for people to pick whatever chain they want.

Finally, unlike a normal ticket stub or plain digital record an NFT ticket can be associated with extra metadata (even after the event). A system like Ticketmaster could add some type of history system so you can view a collection of your previous events and event highlight reels for each but they haven't in 20 years. By contrast, this is much more normal for NFTs already. Integrate this into a digital picture frame and you can have a place on superfan's wall that cycles through highlights of the favorite games they've attended or that lets them build a digital gallery in something like Decentraland and compete with other fans.

So, there's an opportunity here to improve the status quo for venues, performers, and attendees and the only one who stands to lose is a generally reviled middleman. I don't think we'll get as much push-back from the consumers here as we'll see from Gamefi. However, stuff will need to be built.

The UX for buying tickets needs to be tailored to buying tickets. Customers need to see the layout of the venue for the seats being sold, be shown the context of the event, and be offered pathways to deeper engagement with that event‚Äôs community. All of these are UI centric changes that don‚Äôt require much contract code and are ripe for innovation. Adjacent to the chain, the NFT metadata stored on IPFS could be standardized for easier integration into navigation and viewing software.

Assuming devnets run for another month, and then the two public testnets are spaced 3 weeks apart, that would put end March Shanghai. If devnets are run for two weeks and then the two public testnets each spaced two weeks apart, Shanghai date would be early March. Either way Shanghai in March seems increasingly likely (Just my own guessing, nothing official from the core devs on a date yet)

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10jyo68/daily_general_discussion_january_24_2023/j5quguk/)

I'm a long time hodler. At the moment I have most of my ETH staked with CB. With withdrawals coming soon. I figured now is a good time to explore solo staking. Since I'm not tech savvy. I feel solo staking is a little out of my comfort zone. I looked into using dapenode and rocketpool. After looking at tons of videos and guides. I decided to try the rocketpool route. I followed this guys YouTube video. 

<https://youtu.be/-o3IV3AClw8>

I was able to follow along pretty good and now I'm officially running a node on rocketpools testnet. I'm surprised it's actually working. With that said. I feel like I'm missing so much understanding of what is really happening with my node. All I know is I followed a bunch of copy and paste code into the terminal and got it to work. Did I secure my device enough? Did I set up ssh that I have no idea how to use? Is my firewall setup? What is my computer going to do when I lose power? At this moment I'm a very dangerous eth staker. There's so much I need to learn in order to trust myself with staking real eth. I wish there was some kind of staking class I could attend. I'm going to keep learning as much as I can until withdrawals are enabled. Once that happens my eth will go back to the safety of my hardware wallet until I feel 100% comfortable staking on my own. Thanks to everyone of you that help guys/gals like myself. Cheers.

<summary>Random: u/Tricky_Troll decides now is a good time to reflect on the good, the bad and the ugly of how he played the last bull market</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/109rzd5/daily_general_discussion_january_12_2023/j40rrwq/)

**Disclaimer: This is a long-winded reflective post. Skip to the end if you would prefer a TL;DR.**

Now is the perfect time to reflect on your own personal wins and regrets from the bull market just gone. It's quiet, fundamentals are showing strong with Ethereum's strength above $1,000 and a bottom feels like it may have formed. Don't @ me if I jinxed it.

Personally, I'd give myself a 5/10. Overall I did ok.

**The Good:**

My early bull run strategy was good. I sold the last of my Bitcoin after its initial run to $30K/40K as the first part of taking profits. I splashed out on a couple of things I'd been wanting for a while and I diversified into to physical assets as well as leaving some aside for paying tax (just not quite enough in the end üôÉ). Also, losses which will be covered in "The Ugly" were kept to a responsible (enough) % of my stack and I did not double down or try to gamble back shitcoin losses. Losses were accepted and rational portfolio allocations were stuck to. Once the shitcoins went to Goblintown, my precious ETH stack was left untouched.

Finally, I managed to hit my 32 ETH target and run a solo validator node. It was a lot of learning for me but solo staking is very satisfying and worth the effort.

**The Less Good:**

I sold all of my shitcoins and was full ETH by the time the bear market kicked in to 5th gear. This allowed me to fund quitting my job temporarily to go to Hodlercon and do a long delayed trip with my family in the UK. I should have sold these earlier but I managed to shake these bags before we entered Goblintown.

**The Bad:**

I had a cash out plan and my target was not hit as I was hoping. My cash out plan evolved after an event I will cover in the next section. The bad thing is that part of my target was hit and I did nothing about it.

**The Ugly:**

35% of my stack was lost to shitcoins in 2020 and DeFi coins in 2021. Overconfidence from picking out Chainlink in the 2018 bear and then selling the top in late 2019/early 2020 contributed to this greatly. It was a humbling experience but also, unfortunately this loss of 35% of my stack was the reason why my cash out target was not hit. I had a set $ amount I wanted to sell (which would be hit at around a $4.5K ETH) or when a bunch of my favourite indicators on <https://www.LookIntoBitcoin.com> flashed sell. After losing the 35%, the cash out amount crept up since I had less ETH to sell (it went up to about a $9K ETH). Due to the elongated nature of the late bull run, less than half of the sell indicators I was following flashed sell. I tried to time the peak too close. As a result, the peak I expected never came and I never sold when I should have.

**Learnings:**

So what have I learned and what can you learn from me? My first piece of advice is never to double down to re-coup losses. After I lost my shitcoin stack I was tempted to double down and I had other coins lined up. But guess what, those coins did terribly. I would have only lost more ETH and wouldn't be solo staking today. Set aside a portion of your stack to leave invested in ETH for the long run. Do not waver from this allocation. If you find that hard, maybe staking is for you. A 16 ETH rETH minipool or 32 ETH solo node cannot be partially sold. It's a great way to keep assets locked in for your long term investment thesis, also earn a yield and of course help to decentralise Ethereum!

Secondly, I think it's important to stick to a cash out plan. Furthermore, I think laddering out is better too. It's easy to want to hit a target but this market is too unpredictable to rely on such a hit or miss strategy. Everyone is different, so I don't think this strategy suits everyone but if you are someone with a cash out plan, I'd recommend sticking to it and I'd also recommend having multiple targets over a single cash out price.

My final piece of advice is to stay humble and stay cautious. Now that I have experienced the feeling of winning a big bet on one of just 2 altcoins to go on a big run up last bear market and subsequently thinking I'm a genius and can do it again, I see this attitude everywhere. Look at Do Kwon or any of the has beens last bull run. They think they can make a comeback and are trying to build up their redemption arcs. They got lucky. Then they got overconfident and greedy. Then the market turned and their shenanigans that they thought was proof they were geniuses revealed that they really aren't any better than the rest of us. In fact, they're worse. At least I kept my losses limited and didn't keep leveraging up. Keeping my bullishness and self-confidence in check is the only reason I didn't lose it all. There were definitely points where I wanted to go all in on my shitcoins but I didn't because I knew it was irresponsible.

Anyway, I apologise for the long-winded nature of this post. I don't really have the time today to flesh it out into a nice concise ordered write up. I guess I'll leave you with a TL;DR instead.

TL;DR:

- Stay humble. Watch out for the trap of over-confidence after you make a smart investment or two thinking you can do it again. Chances are you can't.
- Keep responsible allocations. I'd have lost it all had I not resisted the urge to double down in an effort to recoup losses. Running a staking node can help with this.
- I recommend cash out plans and sticking to them. Furthermore, laddered cash out plans help protect against uncertainty. My all or nothing plan has left me frustrated and short on liquidity in this bear.

<summary>OPSEC: u/696_eth reminds us of some tips to keep our crypto assets safe and secure</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/109rzd5/daily_general_discussion_january_12_2023/j40d0kx/)

**hardware wallet is a MUST** if you have more than $2k in crypto and you are not cashing that out right now and leaving.

**Transfer your valuable NFTs from hot/burner to COLD (hardware) wallet**. While Gas is still quite cheap at night US time/morning EU time. You can bundle (x20 items) thru OS. Yes, you might end up paying like 0.01-0.02e per transfer.

Another good practice is to use revoke . cash 's application and also remove permissions from time to time.

I know to most people it's a given but I keep seeing people getting hacked here and there and I'd rather remind again. And your not garbage NFTs are valuable to! so remember that. Trust me, it might suck and feel like unnecessary investment and use of money transferring assets but you'd be happy you still have all your stuff cause for non-hardware wallets it's not IF it's WHEN you'll lose it all so act accordingly.

<summary>OPSEC: u/RooftopPortaPotty investigates the Revoke.Cash extension and reveals some privacy concerns</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10amvdl/daily_general_discussion_january_13_2023/j47tn1w/)

The following will serve as an *extremely* abbreviated version of my research into the revoke.cash browser extension, focusing as narrowly on privacy as I can.

Obviously we're taking a different direction here, as this is clearly not a wallet. However, I think its fair to say that this one is particularly relevant to my ethfinanciers.

Revoke.cash was downloaded directly from the chrome [webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/revokecash-web3-scam-prot/nmniboccheadcclilkfkonokbcoceced?hl=en)

<https://imgur.com/CRRvUfJ>

Starting off, the extension's privacy tab on the chrome webstore page looks good. No data collection is always good to see.

<https://imgur.com/qw2xLIY>

Immediately upon installation we see this POST request to Amplitude, an analytics platform.

There are a few identifiers, including 'user_id', 'device_id', 'session_id', and 'insert_id'. Not so great.

And the keen reader may notice the fields 'initial_referrer', and 'initial_referring_domain'. The values here are 'EMPTY', but I take massive issue with this in the case that they are ever used to collect that data.

If they're going to be collecting your [referer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referer) header, the least they could do is misspell it as the HTTP spec does haha.

I will go into how the extension functions in a more extensive revision, which will include a review of some crypto scams, and a taste of malware analysis.

But this single request to Amplitude got me wondering what happens when I visit <https://revoke.cash> using my everyday use firefox installation, with only uBlock Origin and NoScript enabled.

<https://imgur.com/xtgQ1KM>

Here we see a request to hxxps://scripts.simpleanalyticscdn.com/latest.js - An obvious tracker, BOOM instantly killed by NoScript

Worth noting that I did not see a request to this domain when using the extension.

<https://imgur.com/O01Qczo>

Here we see a javascript file trying attempting to force my browser to generate POST requests to 127.0.0.1:8545

Either way, killed by NoScript.

Maybe theres some extension functionality that its trying to interact with?

<https://imgur.com/jwoL55B>

On the bottom right of the page you can see those connections are refused, even with the extension in use. Odd.

<https://imgur.com/dXONMEH>

Back to firefox, we see a request to amplitude just as generated by the extension. However, this time uBlock killed that attempt.

I keep harping on the fact that by installing extensions, you allow them to completely bypass protections such as NoScript and uBlock Origin.

Be careful out there, folks

gm gentlemen,

a quick reminder about the KZG ceremony: <https://ceremony.ethereum.org/>

You can help by contributing your randomness to the whole thing. The more people participate the better, as it only takes one honest person to make the whole thing a success.

It's really easy and fast to do. All you need is an Ethereum wallet address with more than 3 transfers, and then it's just writing some random text and signing a bunch of messages and you're already done. The whole process takes <2 minutes.

You'll get a POAP too, so get going and help secure & scale Ethereum! This will be used for the danksharding implementation later on.

> To make an analogy, your posts about security analysis, and potentially teaching us to do those kinds of investigations ourselves, play the same role in the broader ecosystem that fraud proofs do on optimistic rollups. If you start with a trusted system, and the system is honest, then all is well and good, but if they're not honest, and nobody is checking on them, then they can get away with anything. For such a system to become trustless, you need a sufficient number of capable fraud-checkers who are checking often enough such that there's a near-certainty someone would catch malfeasance if it were present. The more people capable of checking ecosystem tools to see if they're doing bad things, the more trustless the ecosystem becomes. It's really crucial

Beautifully put. To this end, I will be putting together a guide detailing exactly the steps I have been taking, along with resources, and assistance wherever needed. The vast majority of the process is non-technical, just critical thinking with an almost cynical mindset haha.

I previously announced that I will be releasing a more in-depth review of revoke.cash, where this extension will also be used as we explore a variety of interesting crypto scams.

If you're interested in learning more about infosec in a very easy to digest fashion, I would recommend checking that out when it is released.

I have also promised an analysis of [Fire](https://www.joinfire.xyz/).

No commitment to any particular order can be made, but these are all on my plate.

This is last call for requests, before I leave this up to the community to continue.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10cc78w/daily_general_discussion_january_15_2023/j4frjwo/)

So a little something regarding how my staking experience is going.

Prior to the merge I was running Geth on one SSD and Lighthouse on another SSD.

My attestation performance was fairly good, consistently around 97-98%. Back then you didn't rely on the execution client for attesting, just for block proposals, so it wasn't a huge deal if it couldn't keep up.

Coming up to the merge I moved away from Geth and installed Nethermind on the same drive as Lighthouse, and on the other drive installed Teku-Besu (As a fallback pair).

Now with both a consensus client and execution client on the same SSD, and an execution being a requirement, it can't quite keep up. Attestation performance is averaging around 93-94% and I am seeing the occasional message pop up in my logs stating that the execution engine is not in sync.

I've been putting off addressing this for the longest time... But I figure better now than never!

I've ordered an NVMe that has 10x the read/write speeds and 10x the IOPS of the current SSD's I have. Hopefully in the next week I will get it and install it and move the primary pair (Lighthouse-Nethermind) across.

If anyone else has been getting poor attestation performance, this may be something to look into.

<summary>Random: u/benido2030 shares their learnings from 2022</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10d6prc/daily_general_discussion_january_16_2023/j4ktvza/)

I wrote a long post about my [learnings](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/rpgcip/daily_general_discussion_december_27_2021/hq4yyqn/) at the end of 2021. That was (in hindsight) after we had peaked and I think it's just reasonable to update that post and include my 2022 learnings.

1. **Don't invest in last cycles coins** - Still very valid, and probably even more important now that we might be on the verge of recovering and potentially starting a new cycle.
1. **Understand the narrative** - This one is tricky. I think when I wrote this in 2021 I thought by just understanding the narrative and being early you will print. True is: narratives are important, but most likely (at least for me) only really relevant in a bull market. Or the other way around: Narratives are nice in bear market, but that doesn't mean they will safe you. E.g. There was a "real yield" season and GMX did hold pretty nicely, but it's probably an exception. Other narratives didn't help me at all. This leads to:
1. **NEW: In a bear you gotta be patient (and buy ETH)** - Now this sounds crazy, but I really think this might be the biggest learning from the last 12 months. Fade narratives in bear market. Sell last cycles coins. All of them. Don't think they will recover, because even if they do, they will lose vs ETH and you can increase your holdings if you really want to double down. I kept two tokens and let me tell you I am not happy :)
Buy ETH whenever you feel like it (longterm it's most likely a good buy). But also with ETH, be patient, history maybe doesn't repeat but it rhymes. E.g. I bought the bottom at 800$, but I also made some more buys in the other crashes at e.g. 1750. Why? Because of "FOMO", being scared it could immediately pump - which it usually doesn't in a real bear market. There is capitulation in a crash and a time based capitulation. And YES! I know that I / we don't know. And maybe next cycle is different. Still I think understanding what patience means is important.
1. **NEW: Make a bear an opportunity** - This is kind of connected to the the old 6. "Take profits". I think that's still very important: having cash on the sidelines means a crash/ dip might even have a positive side, both for your portfolio but also (and maybe more important) emotionally.
But I think I would go even further: I sold most of my alts in Feb 22. I felt I was late, didn't sell the top, bla bla. In hindsight I think that move wasn't bad at all. But I could have even shorted last cycles trash. Not in a day trading way, but as in shorting and forgetting the short. I was so impressed by some people (especially the Luna short from 100$ to 0 from that one guy that covered his short for 42cents in the end). I know I can't do that, I know he's probably one in a 1000, but I also think there is a valid way that includes shorting when you feel the bear has really arrived.
1. **You can't predict crypto short term, NEW: you can predict crypto long term** - I am more convinced than ever that this is the case and I also think that doesn't really contradict anything I have said before :) But the more important part of this is: I am sure we can predict crypto long term. I'll probably write about this soon, but e.g. "execution layers" aka "L2s" are alpha. Modular blockchains are alpha. ETH as the one global settlement layer is alpha. I can't imagine that L2 tokens won't pump. I am long OP and will try to go long with other L2 tokens, either by buying or CDP.
1. **Finance is a different world** - Still valid, still learning so much, see 4.
1. **Take profits** - I didn't take many profits apart from the alts in Feb, so I sucked here. I was too bullish. I was hoping for 10k ETH, 100k BTC etc. etc. So I am planning profit taking now. I am trying to estimate valid prices to exit certain positions, e.g. by understanding what certain prices say about my tokens, I compare them to evaluations of last cycle (example: If OP reached 20$ that would mean 80B FDV which is close to SOLs mcap last cycle - and I think that's already bullish, even if it's just 10x, compared to SOLs 100x) and try to be more realistic and less emotional when it comes to taking profits. I think I was driven by greed and euphoria last cycle and will try to change this going into 2023 and 2024.

I have some goals for the next 24-36 months and hope that reflecting on my learnings will help me to make stuff happen. Will it be as easy as I think? Def not (but I also don't think it is as easy as it might sound here!). But I want to grow, improve, challenge myself, so we need goals to measure success :)

The Brasky's Strike Back Part II

It's been over 2 months since my wife lost her job and wanted to share an update. We had both found job opportunities on separate coasts of the US and we're prepared to live apart for a few months so that we could find the income to keep the house and wait for something permanent to open up back home. I had even readied the house and advertised it for rental hoping to find a tenant while we were gone.

At the last minute we both found jobs in town...not only did she get hired with full time employment but she'll be making 20% more than her previous job!!! I had been watching our little one as my main trade is in construction and the real money is made on large industrial projects but requires traveling away from home. I had found a part time gig that worked well with our schedules but had to quit as I was going back on the road to work. I got a call right before leaving and a side hustle that I had tried to get started back in August has now just opened up...and I'll be making more than double my previous income while still playing daddy day-care!!!

The last few months have definitely been a trial and has put a lot of stress on our marriage but we came out as better spouses and better positioned than before!! We had enough savings in case of emergencies and I was prepared to start selling my sweet sweet precious ETH if things got worse. We were able to not burn through everything and our ETH stack is still intact earning rewards!! Glad I can share this my ETH fam and anyone else going through the fire. Amazed to have a spouse who can get aggressive and when the bear bites we bite back.

<summary>OPSEC: u/magnushansson shares a new paper on crypto network security</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/103r9ly/daily_general_discussion_january_5_2023/j31az1r/)

Economist Eric Budish [presents a new paper (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYFRQGwe7rI&ab_channel=EconomicsDepartment%2COxfordUniversity) showing skepticism regarding the cost of securing the Bitcoin network. The main criticism boils down to the fact that there is no trust in the system (trustless), in the sense that there is no "memory" to build up trust. A miner is only trusted by spending computing resources right now, but does not get rewarded for building up a good reputation. He argues that although this is a perfectly fine model for security, it get's very expensive. In the concluding remarks, Budish briefly discusses PoS and says that it could potentially be used in a better way.

I think his arguments for the cost of securing the Bitcoin network is interesting and probably valid (depending on what the attack looks like). People in crypto should not be arrogant and dismiss criticism, but instead try to understand all perspectives to be able to build better systems. I'm not sure how trust in a decentralized system would look, or even if it's a good idea (Any Layer0 player comments?). Also, PoS certainly have clear advantages: E.g., the cost of an attack is significantly larger, as the attacker risks losing the capital (not the case with mining). But if the capital required to secure the network needs to be way higher than the transactional value of the network, that could be an obstacle for growth. Are there any attempts to clearly work out the economics for PoS?

Edit:

Thanks for the comments and suggestions to listen to Justin Drake on this, will take a look!

I also found this quite intense twitter discussion on the subject: <https://twitter.com/alexoimas/status/1525505965029830656?s=20&t=X2P3CnyeNNKtinMsJCP9Ww>

And this blog post: <https://hugonguyen.medium.com/a-review-of-budishs-51-attack-theories-what-is-the-fair-price-of-an-old-asic-59a7dcf9ff94> which argues that the scenarios in Budish article are unrealistic. The author also argues PoW > PoS.

For the first time in my 6 years of crypto I am starting to seriously ponder: I do not actually get the 'point' of bitcoin. It's unprofitable to mine it. It pays no yield if you already have it. It doesn't protect you from inflation. It needs a steady supply of greater fools during its cycle because its security costs scale with price (see: boom-bust curve). Its vocal supporters are cringe. I've always agreed that bitcoin is pristine collateral while ETH has a place as a programmable crypto asset but things have changed. I'm at the point where the flippening is not a meme anymore - it is the guaranteed outcome of the supply/demand dynamics that we are witnessing now - just needs more time to play out. ETH is now the pristine collateral imo, and I don't see why in the future ETH can't have flipped Bitcoin multiple times.

<summary>Ecosystem: u/austonst enlightens us to the conflict of interest for entities running MEV block builder and MEV relays</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/105hh6b/daily_general_discussion_january_7_2023/j3cqss0/)

MEV-Boost relay transaction censorship has gotten a good amount of attention since the Merge, and for good reason. Fortunately, word has gotten around and the trend is improving.

So I think it's time to emphasize another problem in the relay space: relays who also run builders. Relay-builders as opposed to independent relays? I need a better term for this. This is informed by my time working on the [Aestus relay](https://aestus.live/), and while I believe our relay can help with this problem, I hope you can trust that my goal here is not marketing. We don't make any money off this relay anyway.

In a world without relays, proposers and builders would have to trust each other directly: depending on the implementation one would always be able to steal MEV from the other. Relays sit in the middle and take on all that trust. As long as the relay is trusted, proposers and builders each enter a trustless relationship with the other.

However, a malicious relay, working with one side or the other, can execute all the attacks they were supposed to prevent. A relay working with a builder can steal MEV from a proposer or the other builders, and likewise, a relay working with a proposer can steal MEV from a builder.

Now let's bring relay-builders into this. An entity that is running both a relay and a builder has a clear conflict of interest. Compromising the relay's neutrality by working together with their builder could immensely improve profitability. Let's list out some potential attacks that relay-builders could carry out. These are in roughly increasing order of subtlety and with names I'm making up on the spot, with "you" being the relay-builder:

1. **Single-Block Copying:** Some third party builder has submitted a block to the relay that is more valuable than the block your builder made. Simply copy all the transactions from the third-party builder's block, but make it so you keep any value that is not sent to the proposer. Send a bid to the proposer with your block instead of the other builder's. A competent builder should be able to detect this and trash your reputation.

1. **Ignoring Other Builders:** A third-party builder submitted a block more valuable than your builder's block. You should pass on the third-party bid to the proposer. Instead, pretend you didn't see it. Submit your builder's bid instead. Done naively like this, the third-party builder should be able to catch it.

1. **Multi-Block Copying:** Multiple builders have submitted blocks with valuable MEV. Build your block from the most valuable transactions from each of them. Make sure your bid to the proposer will legitimately win the auction, but keep the rest of the MEV for yourself. I don't know if builders would detect this, might take some analysis and time.

1. **Obfuscated MEV Copying:** Same as with the first two copying attacks, but with intent to be subtle about it. For example, if a third-party builder/searcher has a truly novel source of MEV extraction that only they know how to do, they'd recognize if it were stolen, so only copy MEV that can be identified as a recognizable strategy and is unlikely to come from a private mempool. Implement some fuzzing, make your copied MEV transactions slightly different so as to give plausible deniability that maybe your builder found that MEV on their own. Might be hard to detect.

1. **Auction Manipulation:** Anyone can check the best current bid through the relay API, which is a problem in itself, but the relay has particularly low-latency access to this info. In case a third-party builder only very slightly outbids your builder, quickly create a new block with a winning bid and propose that instead. The relay has some wiggle room with timing to make sure your builder can always outbid. Catching this would require long-term analysis and may be covered by plausible deniability or obfuscation.

1. **Block Timing Manipulation:** A third-party builder submitted a block more valuable than the one made by your builder. Give your block priority in the relay's block validation system, or better yet, don't waste time validating it at all (you made it, you trust it). Make your competitor's block low-priority for validation or otherwise stall it so it's less likely to be ready when the proposer asks for the best bid. Hard to detect, covered by plausible deniability, and current data APIs don't expose enough timing information to help with detection or can be manipulated. This could be an actual concern.

1. **Builder Colocation:** Most builders will make \~1 submission per second, with value increasing over time as more bundles and tx's arrive. Builders that are geographically closer to the relay, with lower latency, will tend to have slightly higher-value blocks because of it. If a relay and builder are running in the same data center, under the same account/project, on a high-speed private LAN, that will give them a competitive edge. This maybe doesn't quite qualify as an attack, but a neutrality concern at least.

I want to be clear that **I have no reason to believe existing relay-builders are malicious and carrying out these attacks**. But why accept the possibility that they may some day occur? Why connect to relays that require extra trust assumptions when there are alternatives?

Right now, Ultrasound and Agnostic are the only relays not operating their own builders. Aestus is temporarily running a builder, but it doesn't extract MEV, doesn't take any profit, and only operates until we get a reliable set of third-party builders connected (otherwise we might not have any blocks for connected proposers). I would encourage everyone to direct their validators and builders to those relays and to ask existing relay-builders to consider only running one or the other. I'm grateful to the early relay-builders for getting us off the ground, but now we can start to hold the space to a higher standard.

I want to qualify these as "guesses", because reality rarely unfolds as we expect and it would overestimate my foresight to call them predictions. Also, since I'm not making predictions, I acknowledge that it's difficult to quantify the results of many of these guesses.

- Shanghai is likely to happen some time around Tuesday, March 28, 2023. This isn't based on any factual information and I'm VERY behind on core dev calls, but I do think that developers want to push this in March, and Tuesdays are a good day to do these. Guess confidence: 4%.
- Network usage will skyrocket immediately after the merge as people race to take advantage of whatever strategy they've developed to respond to withdrawals. Some folks will be racing to claim stolen beacon chain funds, while others will be racing to save their funds from an attacker. Other people will have novel strategies that I can't conceive. This will lead to high execution rewards for validators who propose those blocks. Guess confidence: 20%.
- MEV block rewards will be very high for several hours based on the previous point. Guess confidence: 15%
- There will be few "real" validator exits, but there will be validator shuffling that will appear as exits and spook some people. For example, providers who have merged or folded will want to re-secure their keys under new management and will exit to re-stake under improved security, but this won't be clear to observers who will only perceive it as "churn". Guess confidence: 30%.
- The price is likely to fluctuate 2% either way, but will quickly reach homeostasis because people are already committed to their positions. There will be sellers who have been eager to claim gains after having locked coins, and buyers who are comforted by the knowledge that withdrawals are real and sustainable. Guess confidence: 0%
- Over the next year, individual deposits to the beacon chain will climb steadily as observers who couldn't commit to an unknown timeline now accept that the beacon chain is stable. I'm expecting 20 million staked Ether aka 625,000 validators by the end of 2023. Guess confidence: 5%
- Large institutions will finally be comfortable depositing their treasuries into the beacon chain and taking staking rewards. This will occur over a 1-3 year period and result in significant locked coins. It remains to be seen whether they'll take a profit maximalist or chain maximalist approach to staking, but based on our educational efforts it's realistic to assume that many of these institutions will recognize the value of decentralization, trustlessness, and chain health when staking. Guess confidence: 10%
- We'll see a new wave of LSD products, with products who support chain health leading the charge, and products who who maximize greed seeing less usage. In simple terms: institutions know that parasitic engagement with the beacon chain will reduce the long term viability of their investment. Guess confidence: 20%
- Public goods like schools/universities, and local governments will slowly begin dipping their toes into staking, especially in cooperatives arranged around DVT solutions that help them dilute the risk of running validators. We ought to promote these cooperatives rather than encouraging centralized approaches. Guess confidence: 2%
- We'll discover that some people and entities have lost staking keys. In the true fashion of cryptocurrency, I expect these keys to miraculously turn up in someone's private possession after many years. Guess confidence: 5%

**BONUS**: What our community can do to support this transition:

- Educate everyone you can about the transition to Proof of Stake. Many people are still unaware that this has happened.
- Talk to people about the relationship between "good staking" on a healthy network and the price. People who think they're staking selfishly will harm themselves by reducing decentralization. Staking in decentralized ways will have a positive impact on the price.
- Help people recognize that withdrawals are a fruition of the promise by core developers to prioritize withdrawals after the merge. They deserve plenty of credit for being consistent and predictable.
- Don't let people get complacent. So many people promised to move to solo home staking, or even just a better staking solution when withdrawals were enabled, but there's a natural tendency to get lazy and complacent when the opportunity is real - don't let people be lazy!
- Keep learning and building. The price is a lagging indicator of what the developers and community bring to Ethereum. You don't improve the quality of your asset by simply watching the price.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/106bh8s/daily_general_discussion_january_8_2023/j3h7bg5)

There was a fairly-notable phishing post on r/CC yesterday where the user mistakenly sent tokens to an address that looked very similar to his actual address (same starting and ending characters). He originally thought he had clipboard malware that changed his address, but it turned out he actually copied to the wrong address.

If you look at his PolygonScan history days before the mistakenly transaction, you can see that he was targeted multiple times.

All these similar-looking address had interacted with his account in the past 2 weeks:

- 0xDD1B7Ce698d0d58Cd521A9c186e6a95CF043614C (his)
- 0xDd12B7E4B8e74745986DD80DDAd191D2a4d7a14C

**This is known as [address poisoning](https://mirror.xyz/x-explore.eth/cL3d_CyNujXq8XY7ueP4omNXx_IY1EG5Dz0FD0vJ90M)**. Attackers send low-value token transactions and receive 0-value token transactions to-and-from your addresses, hoping that you accidentally pick their address in future transactions.

Blockchain explorers and and some wallets will show these transactions. The recommended way to avoid getting tricked is to use an address book of whitelisted addresses. Most wallets and exchanges have an address book feature.

**I've posted a comprehensive list of crypto scams here** along with best practices to avoid getting scammed: <https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/106lsai/comprehensive_list_of_common_crypto_scams_and/>

<summary>Random: u/MinimalGravitas discusses goats and staking?!</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10827ir/daily_general_discussion_january_10_2023/j3qgc9r/)

GM EthFam,

So I've been thinking about whether LSDs represent almost a multipolar trap.

A multipolar trap is a situation where participants are incentivized to act in a way detrimental the good of the group, and to themselves in the long run. The most obvious example is the tradgedy of the commons. We each share a piece of land, it can support each of us grazing 10 goats. If I graze 11 goats the quality of the land might deteriorate, but so slowly it won't matter, whereas I get 10% more goat, it's an obvious choice. Unfortunately you all make the same obvious choice and so the field is overgrazed and after a few years becomes barren and most of everyone's goats starve. If you decide to be the better person and keep to the original limit of 10 goats, then all you're doing is disadvantaging yourself relative to the rest of us 11 goat havers. We can all afford more turnips than you due to goat inflation and so you end up out competed.

Getting back to ether staking... by using a centralized service rather than solo staking you get access to an LSD. This gives you advantages in terms of opportunity access, you can swap into something else if you want to or create leveraged positions or whatever.

Like with the shared field, the disadvantage is on a community level. The decentralization and 'legitimacy' of Ethereum the network, and by extention, ether the asset is compromized, meaning it is less likely to be as highly valued in the future. Sure, you could take the high ground and not use a centralized service, but then are you disadvantaging yourself with lost opportunity cost. And if you do, and most people chose a centralized service then you still lose out from the loss of perceived legitimacy anyway...

...

Except that entire scenario is not analogous to Ethereum staking today due to another option, that hopefully most of you have been hearing repeat in your heads the entire time you've been reading. Rocketpool solves the lose-lose coordination failure, by providing an option that gives people the ability to access an LSD without compromising the decentralization of the whole. With it the multipolar trap is easily disarmed, the field doesn't need to be depleated for individuals to gain the advantages.

RocketPool is the G.O.A.T.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/108x76j/comment/j3vgs6i/)

Don‚Äôt underestimate the decentralizing impact Shanghai will have. Lots of people fully aligned with Ethereum‚Äôs defining values like me have ETH staked with cexs where we would rather not, for various reasons, who will be empowered by withdrawals to revisit their position and consider going solo.

I‚Äôve run validators on testnet but don‚Äôt have the skills/confidence to do it with real money right now, but Shanghai marks a big psychological target for me to remedy that and it‚Äôs very easy to be inspired by people in this sub, describing how rocketpool, dappnode etc. are very easy to do. Plus ethstaker and all the guides. It‚Äôs taking on a huge financial responsibility but it‚Äôs about integrity and aligning one‚Äôs actions with one‚Äôs values and you see that across the Ethereum community and it is inspiring.

It might take 6 months but I‚Äôm really looking forward to watching the transition of ETH from centralized stakers to clean green homegrown (fanless, I recently learned here, so no noise and no fiddly dust hoovering!) validators.

I named my testnet validator raspberry pi ‚ÄòGoldfish‚Äô because I often couldn‚Äôt leave it alone more than a day without it dying. Even put a little goldfish sticker on it. I‚Äôm looking forward to carrying that bs over onto a nuc; name suggestions welcome.

<https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/108x76j/comment/j3vp7io/>

This brings back memories. I was so systems illiterate that it took me about a week to set up my rig before even syncing the block chains. Almost every step in the guides I had to Google something or pester the kind people in the ethstaker discord. I‚Äôd never used Linux before. Had to actually Google where to find the command prompt in Ubuntu as if ‚ÄòTerminal‚Äô wasn‚Äôt obvious enough. Didn‚Äôt know what port forwarding was. Many such examples. Once I finally felt like I knew what I was doing, I wiped the entire system and started again from scratch. Then did that a couple more times. Each time getting quicker and more confident. I think by the 3rd try I had got it down to 30 minutes before syncing the blockchains. I ended up validating on testnet for only 1 day, then swapped over to mainnet. I specifically remember phiz telling me to practice on testnet longer but beacon chain launch was imminent. I hesitated due to no withdrawal mechanism but decided there was no way I was missing genesis lol. It‚Äôs been more than 2 years since then, my rig diligently staking 24/7 without any major problems. In a weird way it‚Äôs been one of the only constants in my life, as life‚Äôs events pass by.

Tldr; I agree Shanghai will likely increase decentralisation. if I can do it, literally anyone can, and will. A focus after Shanghai should be towards making the process easier to ensure it.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/zyspvz/daily_general_discussion_december_30_2022/j27v88q/)

I have a few Rocketpool validators that are currently pending. They should be active in 3 hours. After I write this comment, I'm going to bed. I'm not very active in this sub but I lurk like a mf. I'm feeling inspired to talk about my journey from an ETH Holder to an ETH Staker.

1. First I just want to say that it hasn't been much of a journey. Staking your ETH is not hard. I ran a 8 GPU mining rig for a couple years and the process to set up a validator through Rocketpool is a fraction of the difficulty of setting up a mining rig. Shoutout to the Rocketpool team for the easy to follow documentation.
1. Secondly, along the way, I realized that Rocketpool utilizes almost every novel financial tool that has gained traction in the world of Crypto. Through the process of setting up a Rocketpool node and validators I have interacted with Automatic Market Makers, Liquidity Pools, Flash Loans, and a DAO. I have used all of these novel financial tools to create a stream of passive income. The only thing missing was an NFT. Although I wouldn't really say that I was really missing it Bob.
1. I'll sleep well tonight knowing that when I wake up tomorrow I'll be a wealthier person.

That last statement will remain true until either Ethereum fails or I fail to uphold my responsibilities as a ETH Staker.

ICYMI: The target milestone for 2023 is to ship EIP-4844, aka Proto-Danksharding. If you want to make a difference in the Ethereum ecosystem and you're looking for a way to get involved, learn about EIP-4844 and educate others. While education feels low-value to many people, bringing more eyes to a project like this brings new developers and more momentum. Don't underestimate your own ability to make a difference on the network. I know that withdrawals in 2023 will get a lot of attention, and we know it's in the pipeline, but 4844 is the giant target.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/100d6c2/daily_general_discussion_january_1_2023/j2hswf0/)

My new year's resolution is to focus more on learning ethereum rather than focusing on price.

Lessons learnt in 2022:

1. I lost way too much Eth trying to trade during this bearmarket. Lesson: avoid short term trading. Not worth the time and mental stress.
1. I tried being a degen in 2022 by buying DOGE, trending NFTs, small cap coins and lost more money. Lesson: Be a reasonable investor and accumulate ETH and other high quality assets at undervalued prices.
1. My focus on prices has limited my learning. Lesson: Bear markets are for building and learning.

Goals:

1. Learn about Ethereum and its core upgrades
1. Learn programming - initially python +/- other web2 languages, which should all hopefully give me a good foundation for solidity / ethereum development

Accumulate more ETH

<summary>Analysis: u/RooftopPortaPotty continues their weekly investigation ofnew crypto CHROME extensions</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/100d6c2/daily_general_discussion_january_1_2023/j2jdzfl/)

This is the second installment of my series of posts regarding the privacy of various Chrome browser crypto wallet extensions.

First entry can be found here, where we analyzed Rabby.

My approach:

This analysis has shown that my previous approach of broadly categorizing findings under 'the ok, the bad, the ugly, and the weird' is insufficient, subjective, and does not properly represent what I wish to convey.

Using Kali Linux, I downloaded Google Chrome directly from google.com/chrome.

Analysis of encrypted traffic was completed using BurpSuite + the provided root cert, installed in chrome's local cert repo. Chrome is then launched with a proxy set to Burp's listening port.

I will not be doing any sort of transactions whatsoever. I will, however, connect the wallet to a dapp.

On this New Years Day we will be taking a look at Tally Ho!

The Tally Ho extension was downloaded from <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tally-ho/eajafomhmkipbjmfmhebemolkcicgfmd>

I must start off by giving Tally Ho credit for something that Rabby did not implement. As I went through using the wallet to create a new address, I paid no attention to the seed phrase.

<https://imgur.com/bqsyl6E>

I was hit with a quiz that ensures that the user knows their seed phrase. I reinstalled Tally Ho, created a new address, and passed the quiz this time.

An excellent general security practice that every wallet should implement.

<https://imgur.com/zbJmXcs>

Upon installation, the first request Tally Ho generates is to api.coingecko.com in search of current token prices. Notice crab season in full effect.

<https://imgur.com/seC9btg>

Here we see a request for Arbitrum's token list.

This is a 'web3' wallet, and as such we see many requests destined for chains and defi services that us ethfinanciers wont (admit to, at least) be using much.

An example of such a request, one which is quite demonstrative of the rest, looks like https://imgur.com/AEjA8m1

I dont have a problem with this activity, but it would be great to have a more Ethereum-centric version of this wallet.

<https://imgur.com/VTx7WAJ>

api.blocknative.com is used to fetch Ethereum gas fees and block info.

<https://imgur.com/T3nHyI2>

Tally Ho reaches out to Compound Finance's Github repo 'token-list' for a list of, you guessed it, tokens.

For a benign example of why this is not such a great practice, check out this request to Trader Joe's 'token-list' repo.

<https://imgur.com/LXpv2j4>

The response is a 404. Not a huge problem, just a bit sloppy seeming. Could be bad news if an attacker is able to gain access to that repo, which is likely much less heavily protected than Trader Joe's other assets.

Here is where things get a bit more subjective.

<https://imgur.com/GAT5Bp8>

We see Ankr's API being used to get the ETH balance of my new Ethereum address, notice the value '0x0' in the response.

And for the Alchemy haters, Ive got some bad news:

<https://imgur.com/bsztI6Q>

Alchemy's API is used to fetch my address' balances of various tokens, which are specified by contract address in the POST request body.

You may notice requests to mainnet.infura.io in the above image. No need to worry, these requests were generated strictly by connecting to staking.synthetix.io.

One thing that left me a bit puzzled is this request to resolve.unstoppabledomains.com

<https://imgur.com/0C3NyGb>

My wallet address is sent as a GET parameter. Along with an 'Authorization:' HTTP header.

I have not had much time to look into this service, and would love to know more if anyone has any insight.

Refreshingly, no requests to telemetry services or advertisers were found.

I call upon the great /u/REALJohnBMacLemore. Would you please be willing to do the dirty deed, ser?

Happy New Year, yall!

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1014ypw/daily_general_discussion_january_2_2023/j2osvx6/)

I continue to be amazed by the transparency of Defi sometimes. Just [look](https://llamapay.io/streams?chainId=1&address=ychad.eth) at the Yearn.finance employee expenses here. Continuously streamed, withdrawn whenever the payee wants. Compare this to your traditional corporate payroll system.

1. Why should I need a payroll advance service to draw money I'm already due for hours worked? An entire predatory industry should mostly not exist or at least should be replaced by something like Alchemix. I see no reason something like this couldn't be integrated into a time card system in an automated way for hourly employees too.
1. You know that whole labor board that people go to when their employer did something fucky with their wages? This makes it obvious instantly when the employer is behind on paying wages. The labor board could just monitor registered company addresses and automatically begin a process if a registered account is behind before the employees even notice to report something.
1. Why do you need a W2 when you have something like this? This is an IRS dream come true. Imagine all the management software like AGP you could save businesses.

But you know... people say crypto has no value.

As of right now I have:

- Airdrop scams
- Fake exchange scams
- Excel malware
- Notification that you 'won a prize'
- An offer to use a referral code for 'mutual benefit'
- Someone offering to 10x your investment in 48 hours
- Notification of being whitelisted to participate on a presale
- Invitation to pump and dump discord groups
- Someone asking for help to exchange a token for another in a p2p exchange (despite the token being listen on uniswap with plenty of liquidity)
- A story of a scam crypto startup
- A fake USDC contract migration with instructions to basically get scammed signing some transactions
- The recent fake Chainlink scammer on reddit that DMd some users
- The NVO ICO scam and other ICO scams
- Fake token staking site scams
- Fake token listings on uniswap
- Twitter bots tagging me on fake airdrop claim sites
- Several email scams telling me money has been moved out of my wallet, that I've been hacked and all sorts of shit.

There's one notorious scam I know I'm missing and that's fake support people, so I'd appreciate at least one example of that, not more than one is needed.

If there's any meaningfully different or interesting scams you have examples of, please send them my way. I'd also apprecaite malware or anything that could be misleading to users or put them at risk. Do not post malicious links as a reply to this comment, just DM them to me.

I'm on the EVMavericks discord and moderate the StakeWise discord, verify my username well if you want to DM me on discord, don't get scammed.

A million thanks to everyone that have helped me out !

have a great day my fellow "eth maxis".

bear markets are great for buidlers.

while looking for web3/blockchain related jobs, I began working on my own blockchain project :
I'm building (from scratch front-end/back-end, the whole 9 yards) an LSD niche focused DeX liquidity aggregator.

way down the road, I'm thinking about adding features like evolving the project into a platform that will make it easier for users to participate into liquidity pools, create and run rocketpool minipool, create finance-focused NFTs using oracles and open order books.

even if the project is a total failure and absolutely no one uses it, I'm still happy to be full hand on on it building everything from UI/frontend to the backend and integration APIs of Uniswap/0x and interacting with Rocketpool/uniswap and building smart contracts.

as a software engineer, it's an experience that is like a breeze of fresh air to do a fun side passion project that may or may not transform into a "real" product.

worst case scenario, no one uses it but it gives me legitemacy when talking about my experience in the web3 with recruiters.

best case scenario, users love it and it becomes my full time job.

"average" scenario, it has some kind of traction, and keep being a fun passion project I will maintain while working full time job somewhere else.

anyway, thank you for reading my post, have a great day and may the force be with you
