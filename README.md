Your daily beacon chain dose.

Pending validators: Joining 72.9k, leaving 0

* Entry queue +2300 from yesterday's number
* It will take just over 36 days for the entry queue to clear
* In around 2 and a half days the amount of daily validators that can both enter or exit will be increased from 1800 to 2025

*These figures are based on the entry and exit queue at the time of posting*

[u/monkeyhold99](https://reddit.com/u/monkeyhold99):

Ethereum is the only digital asset in the world that is all of the below:

- decentralized 
- productive 
- secure
- useful 
- immutable
- permission-less
- trust-less 

Traditional finance people and most normies *still* have not figured this out. I know we‚Äôve come a long way since 2015, but I really believe we are super early adopters here. Will be interesting to look back on these threads in 5, 10, 15 years time.

Let's rearrange that and get a catchy acronym.

Secure
Trustless
Useful
Permissionless
Productive
Immutable
Decentralized

ETH is STUPPID!

Great work everyone, take the rest of the day off.

Imagine an Ethereum spam token as a small piece of land in the middle of the desert that has a big sign planted in it saying "/u/barthib owns this". You have no idea who put the sign there, and the land is obviously worthless, so why would you bother driving out into the desert to try to claim it or to take down the sign?

TL;DR Hide it. Don't interact with it or try to "get rid of it".

Conceptually speaking, Ethereum tokens (including NFTs) don't exist "in" your address like ETH does. They exist "in" their own token contract that maintains its own separate ledger. This contract's code is determined entirely by the creator of the NFT.

When your wallet software checks your address for tokens, what it's basically doing (through a couple levels of indirection) is pinging the smart contract that the token creator published, asking it "does this address own any of your token? If so, which one(s) does it own?" The token's creator can, if they wish, tell the contract to respond to this inquiry with literally anything. They could tell your wallet that you own an amount of their token equal to the current block number, or randomize every day the tokens the contract says you own, if they wanted to.

When you interact with a token, your wallet is reaching out to the token contract and running the code defined there by the creator of the token, which can also be anything they want. So a situation like this could occur:

* You try to send the token to the null address.
* By doing so, your wallet calls the "transfer" function on that random token contract.
* The "transfer" function is malicious, and tries to trick you into sending the attacker other tokens out of your wallet, or even just reverts (fails) your transaction causing you to lose your gas fee.

**Edit:** A classic scam is where they code the contract to revert/fail your transaction with a custom error message that includes the address of their scam website in it, telling you to go there for "support" on their token. You see your failed transaction with their custom error message when you go on Etherscan to check whether your transaction went through. So you visit their website and get on their support live chat, and they feed you some bullshit about you needing to install a wallet upgrade from a dodgy .exe file, or that your wallet is corrupted and you need to send them your seed phrase to fix it. Then they clean you out.

Been away in Japan üáØüáµ the last 4.5-weeks or so for vacation. Didn't use the phone much, went camping, did jiu jitsu, was a cornerman for an MMA fighter, went to a baseball game, sumo; just reconnecting and seeing how the ecosystem is. 

* Japan just hosted the G7 Summit in Niigata üáØüáµ where the topic of cryptographic commodities was brought up. There seems to be a [$3000 USD](https://cointelegraph.com/news/g7-pushes-accelerating-global-implementation-of-travel-rule-for-crypto-assets) threshold put on commodities so anything above that amount is reported by the exchange/bank/etc. Seems a bit low relative to what... hedge funds do... ‚õ©Ô∏è üí¥
* Fun Fact. I've spent some time with some cryptographic security people here in Tokyo üáØüáµ and I've been informed something like 33% of all crypto theft occurs to Japanese people. Sure enough, here's an article with [most of those details to back it up](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Cryptocurrencies/North-Korean-crypto-thefts-target-Japan-Vietnam-Hong-Kong) ü•∑

<summary>u/FrenktheTank shares a PSA for Google Authenticator users</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13migau/daily_general_discussion_may_20_2023/jkvh8t5/)

Heads up for everyone using Google Authenticator 2FA app.  While this might be old needs, the update was pushed around the end of April, this was new to me, so maybe some fellow EthFinanciers might find this useful. 

This morning I opened my Google Authenticator app to find out that is needed an update. The update included a back up of the authenticator codes into my google account.   
When I explored this a bit I found this:   

'With this update we‚Äôre rolling out a solution to this problem, making one time codes more durable by storing them safely in users‚Äô Google Account. This change means users are better protected from lockout and that services can rely on users retaining access, increasing both convenience and security.'

Really, how can they think this is save. The whole point is to have a second step besides your standard login option like Gmail. What's the point of storing your 2FA codes in a google account that when it gets compromised, your 2FA codes are compromised as well. 

There is still the option to keep using the authenticator without the backup feature. 

Remember, when it comes to online security, the ultimate responsibility lies with none other than ourselves. Stay vigilant, take proactive measures, and empower yourself to safeguard your digital presence.

<summary>u/LogrisTheBard thinks now is a good time to familiarise yourself with Curve</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13pejil/daily_general_discussion_may_23_2023/jlb7a9k/)

With crvUSD finally launching in earnest now would be a good time to at least familiarize yourself with the Curve ecosystem if you haven't. It's still the second highest volume DEX and might have just launched a way to double its income.

There's a lot to unpack here:

* Curve issuance. How much is being emitted? When are the scheduled emission reductions? Who is sucking it up?
* Bribes. This is basically a way of reallocating liquidity from a trading fee optimal allocation to a CRV holder revenue optimal allocation. This takes a bit to get your head around.
* Curve v2 pools. These are largely misunderstood. Unlike Uniswap or Balancer Curve v2 pools have a volatility instrument in there that flexes liquidity depth to minimize IL and adjust the target peg over time. This is a seriously undermarketed feature.
* crvUSD. A new CDP style stablecoin that uses a gradual liquidation system so you get less wrecked. Lower risk for borrowers, no need for keepers to liquidate you, and it enables high LTV ratios. This is my favorite DAI-style replacement so far. LUSD puts your collateral at risk even pre-liquidation. RAI famously isn't stable. crvUSD is just an improved design of the liquidation system and the peg can be backed by the entire DEX revenue for a stronger coupon bond failsafe than DAI could ever offer.

I do suggest you spend a few hours and familiarize with this system if you haven't because it is the baseline so many other projects derive their tokenomics from.

Not sure if it's been posted yet, but the delegate week started yesterday. If you own any DAO tokens, it's a great time reconsider who you are delegating too. Or even better, if you are on the fence about being a delegate might be a good time to jump into it! 

Some more info here - [https://delegationweek.com/](https://delegationweek.com/) & if you are looking for a list of r/ethfinance delegates check out the daily doots page here - [https://dailydoots.com/#delegates](https://dailydoots.com/#delegates)

If you own any HOP, now would be a good time to consider delegating - whether that is to someone new or just re-affirming with the person you already delegate too. They are using some of the grant funds to encourage people to re-delegate (or delegate if they aren't at all) See - [https://forum.hop.exchange/t/grant-proposal-delegation-week/878/11](https://forum.hop.exchange/t/grant-proposal-delegation-week/878/11). Not a huge amount, and I'm not sure if those are the final numbers, but at a minimum should cover some gas costs + some beer money.

<summary>u/Itur_ad_Astra reflects on a famous crypto saying</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13pejil/daily_general_discussion_may_23_2023/jlbbexm/)

> **Crypto wasn't invented to make you rich...**

I've been in Ethfinance for a few years, and every year, I understand this a little bit more. I joined before the big bull, made some profits, but you don't make life-chaging amounts of money by investing spare change as a broke college student. So I obviously didn't sell during the crazy highs. This year is the year in which I'll be calling myself an "Etherean" for more than I was calling myself a "Bitcoiner".

> **...It was invented to set you free.**

I've got to say, I "converted" to Eth at a good time. Not a good time financially, but at a time where I was disillusioned with Bitcoin. I had heard about Ethereum much earlier, but ignored it, as it was obvious to me that Bitcoiners would not leave the biggest and best coin with *zero* improvements over multiple years, riding on the first-mover advantage alone. What a rabbit hole the Ethereum ecosystem was! What an *insane* potential of improving the way we interact with wealth and capital and as a result the human condition!

> **...But it will make you rich anyway.**

If this part ever comes true, I'm ready, but I hope it's not overnight. I don't know if my mental health can take another insane bull, but I suspect that the next one might be even wilder. At least inflation and time have changed my definition of "life-changing money". In any case... DCA on!

<summary>u/2Nice4AllThis is trying to explain Ethereum for dummies</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13qbpch/daily_general_discussion_may_24_2023/jley82w/)

I‚Äôm working on a few crypto beginner‚Äôs tutorials, with the main goal being to simplify information and for a better learning experience. Ideally, a lot of users don‚Äôt actually need long explanations of how blockchain and dapps work and just want to know how to use them.

Interestingly I wanted to compare simple transacting as copying and pasting an address, and I thought to compare this to being as easy as copying and pasting an IBAN number for digital banking transactions (like in many EU countries). But then it occurred to me that in the US, peer to peer banking transactions are still impossible (which is pathetic), so this reason alone makes explaining this way harder than it should be.

Just a funny observation. What could be a better metaphor for explaining transactions in a ‚Äúcrypto for dummies‚Äù kind of way? I was considering using email addresses as a metaphor, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the best way.

Also, is lack of p2p banking a problem that fednow is trying to solve? It should be a crime how far behind the US is due to lacking simple digital transactions as a standard feature for all bank accounts. Anyway, people generally understand PayPal and Venmo, but trying to explain crypto transactions automatically sounds way more technical if you‚Äôre not already familiar with similar concepts.

<summary>u/Maleficent_Plankton does a deep-dive on ERC-20 vs BRC-20 tokens</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13edhzt/daily_general_discussion_may_11_2023/jjpilb7/)

##**What is the difference between a BRC-20 token and an ERC-20 token?**

Expanded from my comment in /r/ethereum 

####**TL;DR**:

BRC-20 is **completely different** than ERC-20. It has a similar name, which is very misleading because it works nothing like it.

Both are meant to be fungible.

* **ERC-20**:
  * A full smart contract with complete customizability (usually 8k-12k characters long).
  * It must include all the functions that dictate how the token works, so its code is 100x bigger than a BRC-20 token's code.
  * Each ERC-20 token can behave very differently depending on their contract code
* **BRC-20**:
  * A tiny JSON object (usually 100 characters long)
  * BRC-20 tokens are much more **standardized** and do not include any functional code
  * You can only customize 4 properties: Ticker symbol, max supply, # of decimals, and the mint limit

---

##**What is an ERC-20 token?**

An ERC-20 token requires a **complete smart contract** with a full set of code that describes how the token operates. 

All ERC-20 tokens must have these function names and parameters.

* function name() public view returns (string)
* function symbol() public view returns (string)
* function decimals() public view returns (uint8)
* function totalSupply() public view returns (uint256)
* function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 balance)
* function transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
* function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
* function approve(address _spender, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success)
* function allowance(address _owner, address _spender) public view returns (uint256 remaining)
* event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _value)
* event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _spender, uint256 _value)

Only their names and parameters must match. **A function's code does NOT have to match the description of its name**

I could make a valid (but scammy) ERC-20 token where the "**transfer**()" function actually mints tokens, and where the "**approve**()" function instead burns a large amount of your transferred Ether. And that would be technically valid as long as the code specifies it.

##**What is a BRC-20 token?**

First off ... documentation on the BRC-20 standard absolutely sucks: <https://domo-2.gitbook.io/brc-20-experiment/>

I thought it was a joke, but that's the full token standard documentation.

Some more info:

* <https://domo-2.gitbook.io/brc-20-experiment/examples>
* <https://thebitcoinmanual.com/articles/brc-20-tokens/>

BRC-20 is just a short JSON object (a simple data structure) and does not contain any functions. It's based on ordinal theory and relies on the ordinal nodes to operate on it and provide it with **standard** functions.

It only works with ordinal-compatible taproot addresses.

**Here is the standard format of a BRC-20 token**:

* **Protocol**: Specifies the type of ordinal transaction. Always "brc-20".
* **Operation** - One of 3 different operations
  * Deploy: Deploys the BRC-20 token
  * Mint: Mints new tokens as long as it's not past the max supply or mint limit
  * Transfer: Mints a transfer function
* **Ticker symbol**: A 4-letter ID
* **Max supply**
* **Mint limit**: Limit per ordinal transaction that users can mint themselves
* **Decimal precision**

This is what the entire ORDI token deployment looks like:

```
{ 
  "p": "brc-20",
  "op": "deploy",
  "tick": "ordi",
  "max": "21000000",
  "lim": "1000"
}
```

**Here is the format of a Transfer function**:

* **Protocol**: Specifies the type of ordinal transaction. Always "brc-20".
* **Operation**: Transfer
* **Ticker symbol**: A 4-letter ID
* **Amt**: The amount to transfer

To transfer, it takes 2 steps:

1. Inscribe the transfer function to yourself
1. Send the inscription from your wallet to the other address

Swaps require an off-chain 3rd-party to complete, so they're not safe at the moment. It remains to be seen if you can build trustless DeFi around BRC-20 tokens.

**Some other interesting facts about BRC-20 tokens**:

* BRC-20 tokens rely on ordinals and inscriptions to work. This uses the prunable witness section of a Bitcoin transaction that costs 4x fewer sats per byte.
* BRC-20 Tokens currently account for [**over half of all Bitcoin transactions**](https://dune.com/queries/2432967/3996835)
* BRC-20 tokens are **so small** (in terms of weight) that **Bitcoin TPS has actually [doubled over the past month](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/transactions-per-second)**. This is not due to more demand, but because the average transaction size has gone down (due to fewer batch transactions), so they can pack more Txs into each block.

It wasn't catastrophic, but it easily could have been a serious, but recoverable, issue if it had persisted. Epoch 200,553 only had 40% voting participation, which means only 40% of validators selected at random for block creation were actively confirming new blocks. Normally, the participation rate should be much higher, so this could indicate a problem with the network.

[u/superphiz](https://reddit.com/u/superphiz):

A tiny update on the loss of finality yesterday: The culprit still isn't clear.

Some people have suggested Prysm caused the issue because they were hit hard by lost attestations and high loads, but this is very likely a side-effect of the turbulence rather than a cause. [Terence](https://twitter.com/terencechain/status/1656789550948311042) described some optimizations they were making as a result of the turbulence, but that's not an admission of fault.

I initially threw shade on MEV-boost because of my distrust for that stack, but there's no evidence suggesting they are involved in any way. 

The investigation is ongoing and the outcomes will be published in a detailed postmortem.

[Terence just posted another update](https://twitter.com/terencechain/status/1657021042110631936), but keep in mind, that this isn't a finding of fault, they're just exploring the incident. 

Most clients (except Lighthouse) were hit hard by this, but Prysm stands out because they have a high representation of validators.

> Terence just posted another update  
>  
> , but keep in mind, that this isn't a finding of fault, they're just exploring the incident.

Here's my best attempt at an ELI5:

CL clients were getting a lot of attestations (which are like votes or confirmations from other nodes) about older transactions that didn't include the latest updates. This is like getting a lot of mail about old news that doesn't include recent important events.

Because the nodes that sent these attestations didn't have all the information for the recent transactions, CL clients had to spend a lot of time and resources to catch up. This is similar to how you'd spend a lot of time and effort researching recent events if you only had old newspapers. This caused the CL clients to work too hard and run out of resources, leading to issues like the system slowing down or even crashing.

During this time, a small problem in the Prysm system (which likely exists in other clients as well) was found that made it use the wrong information when trying to organize transactions. It's like sorting mail into the wrong categories because you're using an outdated list.

The Prysm team is working on improvements to prevent these issues from happening again. They're improving the system's memory management, and they're going to implement similar logic which right now only exists in Lighthouse CL clients where they filter out unviable attestations (like disregarding old news that's no longer relevant). The Prysm dev team plans to release these improvements next week.
  
So, in summary, the Prysm nodes were overwhelmed with outdated information, which led to system issues and revealed a minor bug. The Prysm dev team is now working on fixes and improvements. I am hopeful other CL clients follow suit and implement similar fixes.

<summary>u/wolfparking has a synopsis on the US House of Reps crypto meeting</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13fbc6v/daily_general_discussion_may_12_2023/jju7s0y/)

##Summary/Highlight of US House of Reps session: Future of Digital Assets. 

Pleasantly surprised by most of what was discussed. Almost all the guest speakers had excellent ideas and explanations in the discussion. However, each person was allocated only 5 min at a time, so it was somewhat limiting. Please excuse me if some of this is a little raw. It is a 3 hr meeting and I don't have the time atm to format it correctly due to my excessive fiat mining op (work).

**Intros of Committee and Guest Speakers:**

Mr Johnson: Must be a bipartisan effort for a promising tech/market. Conflict between securities and commodities laws. Most of the G20 countries are ahead of us. We want to be the leader in this tech/industry.


Ms Caraveo: Digital asset activity grows, but so does non-compliance. Any legislation requires increased funding of CFTC.


Mr Hill: Can this industry thrive here in the US? Many Democrats calling for common sense legislation for months (not just a partisan issue). Can't trust offshore exchanges (FTX), so we need to work on laws here for US exchanges.¬†


Mr McHenry: We want a collab of CFTC and SEC to make laws and close regulatory gaps to protect consumers.


**Guest speakers**


Durgee: I'm the only non-attorney here. Already there are conflicting laws against other existing laws for crypto from the SEC and CFTC. This is a developing tech innovation that happens to be a digital currency as well. Adoption at this stage is not a tech problem, it's a human conditioning issue. A 13 year old in their lifetime has grown up with BTC and only known a world with crypto in their life.


Mr Santori: Kraken is well established in the US and the world. Europe has more effective rules from tested principles unlike the US. Gaps in US have created litigation that doesn't protect consumers. Mandates needed to protect us: <https://www.youtube.com/live/gwJ1QAwP7UE?t=43m21s>


Mr Massad: Confusion about commodity/security classification of crypto worsens the gap problem. How can we apply Howey test without this info? We need to pass a compliance law directing CFTC and SEC (or SRO; self regulating agency) to create laws and enforce them, without rewriting commodities and securities laws. Regardless of your stance on crypto we need this framework to protect consumers.


Mr Blaugrand: If investors could have traded digital assets on an exchange that was regulated like the NY Stock exchange, FTX situation wouldn't have happened. We can use the established rules we already have and apply it to crypto with these 4 rules: <https://www.youtube.com/live/gwJ1QAwP7UE?t=58m34s>

Mr Steil (WI): We still have no path forward for regulation, even after Gensler's meeting with Congress. Congress is ready to do the job. How do we not miss out vs overseas? W/Shoenberger: Switzerland made it very clear to define security/commodities. It gave them legal security and clarity that allowed them to proceed successfully. This framework that they provided certainly provided the legal certainty to be headquartered there and to have legal clarity around the classification instantly. W/Durgee: The rest of the world has more stability and growth in every avenue of crypto. 3x as much investments vs the US in some markets.

Mr Lucas: US is great because we embrace innovatio. w/Santori: G20 markets are ahead of us and are sophisticated. Kraken is expanding there, but we can't deploy the same resources here in the US due to these regulatory gaps. Lucas: what SEC rules need altering for exchanges to succeed? W/Blaugrand: SEC needs an onramp with regulation so exchanges can grow in the US. They don't because of regulatory vagueness. W/Satori: Flexibility of crypto is a perk. Broker/dealer construct can interact directly with consumers. We could limit exchanges and even close down exchanges after hours.

**The negative:**

Lynch (Mass): Not regulatory ambiguity; it's mass non compliance with existing laws. Don't argue security vs commodities, we should instead focus on intermediaries (exchanges, lenders, and wallet users). SEC is clear, consistent, efficient, and prevails in every 140 cases. crypto industry has failed. No separate regulatory regime necessary for crypto. claimed that creating new legislation for digital assets seems ‚Äúredundant and unnecessary‚Äù given that the financial system‚Äôs current securities laws have ‚Äúsustained massive innovation in our financial system for decades."

Mr Casten: What return would I had if I invested in 12 cryptos during a time vs S&P (60% profit)? Loss 46% of investment, how is this a supposed way to close wealth inequality gap? W/Durgee: accredited vs credited access is important. Mr Casten: I'm happy to debate truth not lies. Everything stated here beginning to sound like SBF and FTX, what's the distinction? Sounds like you want to regulate crypto with the least funded organization.

Mr Sherman: Buttcoin mod? An ignorant person's lack of ability to learn anything new. Fossil garbage opinion. Uses term "crypto bro". questioned whether digital assets should even have a future in the United States. He referred to cryptocurrencies as a ‚Äúhidden money system that diverts capital investment from useful industries, and whose announced purpose is to defeat sanctions and tax laws. 
Crypto bros make money literally by making money, and they‚Äôve made over a trillion dollars. They‚Äôll accuse the U.S. government of making money out of thin air. Maybe we do, but we‚Äôre the U.S. government."


**Threaten Web3 Anonymity:**

Mr Davidson (Chairman Housing subcommittee): Gensler's hotel California's regulation provides no path to exit/leave. Who should have the power of exit from intermediaries (power to have self custody)? w/Santori: Who is best placed to collect KYC info? Kraken is well paced to do that and doesn't require KYC for every transaction, but we could do that if required.

Dr Foster (IL): Estimates of 95% trades are fake or wash trades in derivatives. How can we have a regulated futures market with this fraud and manipulation? What alternative to KYC at all levels is there to avoid fraud? W/Satori: Kraken provides this as a portal. Foster: we can't stop BTC on the dark web with that. At a wallet level we must have mandatory monitoring with licensing like automobiles. Trusted digital identity from the government. W/Kulkin: CFTC had auth it could conduct surveillance under the rules and jurisdiction of the exchange thereby acting as an SRO in addition to the CFTC/NFA. 

**Conclusion** 

McHenry: Even if there is nothing of value in crypto, you would still need enforceable rights and protections already found in regulations and laws in the US.  Must come together in bipartisan manner to protect investors. 

5 days for additional legislation questions and responses granted from the panel. Plans for another hearing this month made. 

Last month, McHenry said he expects that the President will have signed some piece of crypto legislation into law within the next 12 months.

<summary>u/T0Bii starts a discussion about different client pairs and the finality issues</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13g7s03/daily_general_discussion_may_13_2023/jjzailv/)

Anyone else here whose validators had no problems during the finality issues?   

What clients are you running?  

What are your hardware specs?  

I missed an average of 1 attestation per validator that day and my inclusion distance was around 0-1 as well. I'm running Nethermind/Nimbus.   

But I saw a big increase in CPU and bandwidth use, between 2 and 3x of the usual average, spikes even higher.  

That's not a problem for my staking machine, but if others had similar spikes, I can totally see why many had issues.

<summary>u/Ethical-trade comments on the communication between EVMavericks and EthFinance and u/juxtanotherposition shares some notes from EVMavericks oDAO meeting</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13h32x6/daily_general_discussion_may_14_2023/jk3rlbf/)

[u/Ethical-trade](https://reddit.com/u/Ethical-trade):

Respectful criticism:

I'm a bit disappointed to see that despite the idea of the the ManeNet DAO joining Rocket Pool's oDAO having emerged from r/ethfinance and having received [great support](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/135bq9m/daily_general_discussion_may_2_2023/jijszul/?context=3) from r/ethfinance, all of the conversation has now moved over to [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/963992696387694592/1104380534253158470).

I realize that this is a very specific topic and most of the conversation shouldn't happen in r/ethfinance. But it would still be great to discuss ideas in this sub too when needed, and keep the entire community informed of the latest news.

For example, did you know that there's a proposal being drafted that has been in the making for a week? Or that a dedicated meeting happened on Friday?

Like many others I don't like Discord, I find it messy and a pain to follow so I don't use it. Maybe I'm just too old for the "chat" format.

Would it be possible for one of you Discord guys to keep us informed in here from time to time? I'm sure many here would love to be kept in the loop and even contribute.

r/ethfinance gave birth to the ManeNet DAO after all, and all EVMavericks were Ethfinancers before becoming lions.

[u/juxtanotherposition](https://reddit.com/u/juxtanotherposition):

In the spirit of sharing more from EVM Discord to r/ethfinance and about the example [that brought it up](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13h32x6/daily_general_discussion_may_14_2023/jk3rlbf/), I shared my notes from the 1st Discord Call about the oDAO on Discord, but haven't shared them here yet:

>I was taking notes for myself and I've put that into Pastebin (unlisted) ([https://pastebin.com/nrmwEyGg](https://pastebin.com/nrmwEyGg)). I'm sure there are lots of errors, incomplete thoughts, and typos.

Also, I tend to ignore Discord except for something I'm very interested in (like the oDAO). So I sympathize with the comment poster. As an EVM holder, I'm loyal to the dailies, but not the Discord. So I miss some EVM things when they don't make it back here. h/t u/Ethical-trade

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13hy6ue/daily_general_discussion_may_15_2023/jk7f7vc/)

So while I was gone and there was all that drama with the beacon chain, my Teku node got caught up in it and fatally crashed and was completely offline.

However.... I run a second Ethereum "stack" with Lighthouse as the consensus client, which the validator process switched over to and was able to carry on with no downtime like nothing even happened.

I was able to recover the Teku node in my own time, and once it was back in sync the validator process automatically switched back over to it as the primary endpoint.

Client diversity is awesome!

<summary>u/maninthecryptosuit explains the big Ledger drama</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13ivi8v/daily_general_discussion_may_16_2023/jkc5s70/)

Just found this confirmation:

[Ledger co-founder Nicolas Bacca confirms the seed phrase leaves the device (may only be applicable to Nano X.)](https://reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/13itm7u/-/jkbyyfp)

> The device sends encrypted shards of your seed to different companies if you decide to use the service. You can of course still choose to backup it yourself.

[But 2 days ago the same co-founder said:](https://reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/13gs0xn/-/jk34kcn)

> Your keys are always stored on your device and never leave it

That's what Ledger has been claiming for years as well. 

**If we assume the chap wasn't lying 2 days ago, that means the new firmware ( [one screenshot shows 2.2.1 for Nano X](https://reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/13iocfk/so_even_if_i_dont_use_this_service_my_ledger_nano/) ) that just rolled out activates the backdoor "ability" to extract the seed.** 

More info: [Wired article](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/ftx-crypto-investors-hardware-wallets) says:

>Ledger is preparing to launch a new service called Ledger Recover that splits a wallet recovery phrase‚Äîbasically, a human-readable form of the private key‚Äîinto three encrypted shards and distributes them to three custodians: Ledger, crypto custody firm Coincover, and code escrow company EscrowTech.¬† If somebody loses their recovery phrase, two of the three shards can be combined‚Äîpending an ID check‚Äîto regain access to the locked funds. Essentially, Ledger Recover is an additional safety net; for the price of $9.99 a month, it takes the jeopardy out of crypto‚Äôs version of stuffing dollars under the mattress. It‚Äôll be available in the UK, EU, US, and Canada and come to other territories later in the year.

[Ledger CEO Tweeted it out as well. ](https://twitter.com/_pgauthier/status/1653463160370675730)

Why this is an issue - even if Ledger now cancels their new seed cloud backup service (because backlash), and says they will never make a firmware update use this hitherto unannounced "ability", the mere presence of this backdoor means that bad actors/governments may be interested in it. I guess this is what we get for trusting a company that kept its software closed-source.

My next steps:

- Immediately stop using Ledger Live
- No more firmware updates
- Hope and pray that my ancient Nano S devices didn't have this backdoor

With ledger (potentially) going full retard again, I'm updating myself on what hardware wallets are available in the market right now. Looking forward to if anyone has other suggestions, additions or corrections to my high-level assessments below.

I've been using this list for discovery (trying to narrow down the list of 387 wallets): https://walletscrutiny.com/?verdict=reproducible&platform=hardware 

There is an insane amount of options in the market, but very few can fit these requirements;

-	open source everything, including firmware and hardware
-	uses a secure enclave for cryptography (extremely hard to get the private key material out of the device, [apparently controversial given their closed nature](https://blog.trezor.io/introducing-tropic-square-why-transparency-matters-a895dab12dd3))
-	has a display that shows information about what you're signing (the bigger the better)
-	At the very least supports both EVM chains and bitcoin-type chains (bonus for other chains and other curves, e.g. edwards)
-	reproducible firmware builds, i.e. you can tell that the firmware blob matches the published code

I've discarded a bunch of products (e.g. ngrave) that have little to no information about their device or the software that runs on it. 

What I've found that (superficially) gets closest to the requirements (in no particular order);

#### trezor

- I have tried the trezor one, but the hardware died a few years ago
- open source [firmware](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware), [hardware](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-hardware)
- does not use a secure enclave
- reproducible builds
- has a display that shows information about what you're signing
- been around for ages so its been battle-tested (plenty of fixed side-channels issues etc) and its weaknesses are somewhat well understood (limited physical security etc)
- works with BTC/EVM/Cryptonote chains and others

#### keystone

-	open source [firmware](https://github.com/KeystoneHQ/keystone-se-firmware)
-	open source [hardware](https://github.com/KeystoneHQ/Keystone-developer-hub/tree/main/hardware)
-	large display
-	secure element
-	unclear if builds are reproducible
-	supports btc/evm chains and a ton of other more oddball stuff like cardano, tezos etc
-	never heard of it before today, no idea how battle-tested it is

#### cypherock 

- never tried
- open source [firmware](https://github.com/Cypherock/x1_wallet_firmware)
- open source hardware
- no display!
- uses secure enclave (smart cards)
- reproducible builds
- pretty new, haven't seen anyone take it apart/try to break it yet

#### Bitbox02

-	never tried
-	open source [firmware](https://github.com/digitalbitbox/bitbox02-firmware)
-	open source [hardware](https://github.com/digitalbitbox/bitbox02-firmware#hardware-docs)
-	small display, displays some information about what you're signing
-	uses secure enclave AFAICT (ATECC608B)
-	reproducible builds
-	supports btc/evm chains
-	been around for a while, has had a few vulnerabilities (e.g. https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-18673)

#### keepkey

-	never tried
-	open source [firmware](https://github.com/keepkey/keepkey-firmware), hardware
-	reproducible builds(?)
-	small display showing information about what you're signing
-	trezor clone?
-	supports BTC, ETH, LTC, DOGE (and a few more similar coins)
-	been around a long time, has had multiple vulnerabilities (e.g. https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-30330)


#### Grid+ Lattice1 (closed source)

- **closed source firmware, hardware**
- I have one of these, the UX is OK, but the device itself is huge
- large display, detailed transaction information including native smart contract support (when ABI is available)
- tamper-resistant
- uses secure enclave (in device, and smart cards)
- no reproducible builds as its closed source
- pretty new, haven't seen anyone take it apart/try to break it yet, but the described design seems sensible

<summary>u/Bob-Rossi discusses DAO delegation and reminds us of our duties!</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/13jryjf/daily_general_discussion_may_17_2023/jkhzazl/)

To those who own governance tokens / participate in governance, you should check out Tally's [governance-week](https://delegationweek.com/). They are coordinating with a bunch of DAOs to encourage people to delegate or periodically revisit your delegated tokens. A great place for ethfinancers to start is looking at [https://dailydoots.com/#delegates](https://dailydoots.com/#delegates) to find out who on this forum is a delegate. 

The HOP bridge protocol is one of the partners and will be providing some funds from the grant pool to support Tally on this project. The exact details on how they will incentivize is not finalized yet - initial discussions where subsiding gas fees, but looks like it might be shifting to a distribution to those who participate ([the forum discussion is here](https://forum.hop.exchange/t/grant-proposal-delegation-week/878/11)). Either way, I'm happy to see HOP providing support!

That all said, whatever governance token you own please consider usings this week as a chance to re-visit your delegated tokens. It's an important step for the health of a DAO, as set it and forget delegating can stagnate a DAO's leadership and create a barrier to entry for new delegates to join in. And if you are looking to become a delegate this may be a great opportunity to jump in!

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/130aejt/daily_general_discussion_april_27_2023/jhwh329/)

If you've ever visited EthStaker's website before, you'll have seen that it was... largely unnavigable. Well - we wanted to build a new, open source one, so we put out a call on r/ethstaker to see if we could find someone from the community, familiar with staking, to help us do it. [u/hanniabu](https://reddit.com/u/hanniabu) is awesome and did it!

So now EthStaker has [a new open source website](https://ethstaker.cc)!! Feedback would be most appreciated, especially from ethfinanciers. What would help you find the info you want about staking? I didn't love giving people discord and subreddit links when they asked for resources, so I'm pretty stoked to be able to give them a website where everything is aggregated.

I'm also gonna post a series of 'beginner guide to staking' blog posts over the next couple weeks (at https://ethstaker.cc/blog), would REALLY love feedback on that from someone who *sorta* knows what staking is but wants to know more. Mostly for readability

<summary>u/696_eth discusses a new entrant in the decentralised liquid staking game</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/131i3ej/daily_general_discussion_april_28_2023/ji2w589/)

I looked into DIVA and wrote [a twitter thread](https://twitter.com/696_eth/status/1651804749245870081) about them yesterday.

Here's a quick summary for Ethfinance:

* Diva is a decentralized way of staking
* **Di**stributed **Va**lidation staking thru Distributed Validator Technology (DVT). Trustless. Resilient. Secure. Cause of fully distributed network of validators. Entrance as low as 1E.
* Liquid staking. You would stake to get divETH, which operates kinda like stETH. You can wrap into wdivETH which operates like rETH/wstETH. This can be tax advantageous depending on your preference of incoming vs capital gains.
* You would have an option to run a node for extra rewards (split 50% between stakers and node runners in the final Phase 2 version on the mainnet). There's some minimum hardware requirements. 
* It's currently on the testnet. Should be live on mainnet in Q2

The key points is that I've learned is that combines liquid staking with DVT. Since it uses a smart contract to pool funds it can be as low as 1E. Honestly, I'm waiting for a bit more info after their testnet releases to see how it pricesly protects against penalties and bad actors and why 1E would be safe. Also, not enough info on Node Operators and right now you would not be able to run one on the testnet. 

Side note. SWISE vaults might be in a similar vein I guess.

[Diva's site](https://divalabs.org/)

[An extra useful article](https://divalabs.medium.com/how-diva-is-designing-a-more-trustless-staking-solution-acc96ca5a549)

Please correct me if I misunderstood something or if you wanna educate me more, this was a new concept for me so it was a bit hard wrapping my head around it when figuring out how diva is planning to make it work not just in a theoretical way.

<summary>u/Tricky_Troll makes an analogy about crypto legislation</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/132jpw8/daily_general_discussion_april_29_2023/ji5s7ln/)

It's the 1920s, you're starting to see these fancy new self-propelled horseless carriages or "cars" pop up everywhere. They look really cool but they're also quite dangerous. This is what the kerfuffle is about in the congress at the moment. Everyone knows that we need to protect people from the maniacs on the road. But astute observers also realise that we also need to protect the innovation and economic advantage these new-fangled machines provide.

Lawmakers are split on what to do. Representative Emmer thinks we need new laws. "Rules of the road" for all to comply with. Rules which all road users must follow specifically designed to create order out of the chaos on the road while still allowing for fast, efficient travel. But senator Warren disagrees. She thinks these new machines should be treated like horses under the ancient 1839 "Horse and Carriage act". She doesn't care that horses are slow, living creatures which need to eat, sleep and poop while cars are fast, furious and can run all day. She insists that these roads were built for horses and that makes anything on those roads a horse, dammit!

Don't be like senator Warren.

**Edit:** If anyone with some clout on Twitter wants to screenshot this and run with it, go for it. Or if you reckon you can take the idea and shorten it down to the Twitter character limit, that would be impressive so go for it.

Chris Blec posted on twitter and called out rocketpool.  However... hes actually right?

[https://twitter.com/ChrisBlec/status/1652498398459699202](https://twitter.com/ChrisBlec/status/1652498398459699202)

I looked into oDAO and it is exactly what he describes it as.  

Everything more and more just feels like decentralization theater...

The fact that it is invite only is despicable and counter to any ethos regarding decentralization.

[u/Datacruncha](https://reddit.com/u/Datacruncha):

Ethereum's consensus layer and execution layer currently don't talk to each other so you need oracles for something like rocket pool. The odao does all the oracle work for rocket pool and upgrades the smart contracts. They can technically collude and cause massive damage so the best way to prevent this is to overpay and only include trusted people. Yes, the work is fairly easy and not worth half a million a year and everyone wants a spot. Thankfully, a lot of the money goes to fund client teams which helps ethereum run and keeps it decentralized. 4 spots are allocated to the rocket pool team to help fund development. Sassal donates all his earnings. 

Eventually, there will be less of a need for the odao with upgrades to Ethereum like eip 4788. If anyone has any  technical or economic suggestions about the odao they can post in the rocket pool forum or the research section on discord. Please note, it takes very little effort to criticize and substantial amounts of time and coordinated effort to come up with working solutions.

<summary>u/MerkleChainsaw is looking for real adoption and u/silentjxhn makes a great list of examples</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/134d3x2/daily_general_discussion_may_1_2023/jigbkxt/)

[u/MerkleChainsaw](https://reddit.com/u/MerkleChainsaw):

Long term, I'm very positive that Ethereum will eventually dominate the crypto space and that it will address most major technical challenges, even if it takes another decade or two. I'm pessimistic about crypto overall though.

I'm still on the sidelines because I'm having trouble seeing how crypto overall will achieve *true adoption* anytime soon. I define "true adoption" very narrowly as significant demand for ETH to be used for some external purpose other than crypto speculation or facilitating crypto speculation. So for example providing DEX liquidity, staking/validation, and issuing most tokens or NFTs don't count since the demand is mostly based on putting fiat into crypto hoping to get more fiat out. Things that do count include airline or concert ticket NFTs, using ETH contracts for supply chain tracking or audit, and so on. In these cases someone is willing to buy ETH because they can use it to solve an actual problem. I think most other successful technologies were solving real world problems by this stage in their development.

Where can this adoption come from? After all the scams, fraud, and hacks I'd have trouble convincing any company board to use public blockchains beyond maybe an NFT cash grab offering, if for no better reason than avoiding the reputation risk and liability from using crypto. Even a simple use case like accepting stablecoins as payment is tough because every major stablecoin has depegged at some point.

Though it's small, I think EVMavericks is an example of true adoption. Demand for most people is based on "I'd like to be a member of a club" rather than "I'd like to sell this JPG for a profit". Maybe some Reddit avatars count in this category as well?

Is there anything on the horizon that I'm missing? Financially I want to buy ETH because it has an asymmetric distribution of returns, and I believe Ethereum is one of the only projects in crypto being designed with good intentions and a long term focus. On the other hand I'm increasingly having trouble seeing where enough new demand will come from to justify a $220B valuation.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/135bq9m/daily_general_discussion_may_2_2023/jikbng0/)

Here's your new monthly staking update: 

**Validator overview - total: 619346 validators\***

* 554322 active
* 18350 pending
* 7333 exiting
* 39341 exited

**Client diversity numbers\*\***

* Consensus: Prysm 38% // Lighthouse 37% // Teku 17% // Nimbus 6% // Lodestar 1%
* Execution: Geth 64% // Nethermind 16% // Erigon 11% // Besu 8%

**Pool distribution\*\*\***

* Unknown 41,8%
* lido 23,3%
* Coinbase 9,6%
* Binance 3,7%
* Kraken 3,5%
* Rocket Pool 2,7%
* \+ a lot of whales, smaller staking providers etc. 

My goal is to show how things develop and answer questions like "How many validators will secure the network by EOY if net new validators are constant", "Is client diversity improving" and "How is the dynamic between centralized pools and decentralized stakers". 

If you think something very important is missing, let me know and I'll add it today or tomorrow, so we can work with it in June. Best case share your source, so I know where to find the stats. 

This post will contain more information and probably some conclusions in the future, I hope this will be a good summary and help for those who don't check numbers regularly (I basically didn't do it and could not tell you how things are developing right now)

**Some comments and sources:**

All percentages are rounded, so this is not 100% accurate, but should be good enough to show changes in the coming months.

<summary>u/Ethical-trade has a cool idea for EVMavericks</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/135bq9m/daily_general_discussion_may_2_2023/jijszul/)

Here's an idea: EVMavericks' ManeNet DAO becoming a Rocket Pool oDAO member.

Aren't we an ideal and trustworthy partner that highly values decentralization?

Edit: just realized how unwelcoming this post must feel to any new member. So let's explain a few things for our most recent friends: 

A while back r/ethfinance launched its own NFT collection, [EVMavericks](https://opensea.io/collection/evmavericks) and used the occasion to launch a DAO, the ManeNet DAO. From [its website](https://dao.evmavericks.xyz/): *"ManeNet DAO advances the decentralized Ethereum Web3 ecosystem by aligning shared member incentives with funding, developing, and promoting public goods and education"*

[Rocket Pool](https://rocketpool.net/) is a liquid staking protocol, and the oDAO is *"the group of special Rocket Pool nodes that are responsible for the administrative duties required by the protocol that cannot be achieved by Smart Contracts due to technical limitations".* The "o" in oDAO stands for "oracle".

So basically the idea here is to have an r/ethfinance native DAO help Rocket Pool with some of its duties. This job pays rather well, and the money could, according to the ManeNet DAO's mission, be used to advance the decentralized Ethereum Web3 ecosystem.

Yesterday, u/Ethical-trade made a post about how the EVmavricks should join Rocket Pool's oDAO. I loved that post so much, I covered it in today's Rocket Fuel - making the case that I strongly support them joining. 

I support ManeNet DAO joining the oDAO so strongly that, in the episode, I made the offer of lending the DAO the 1750 RPL needed to cover the bond if they are selected. 

Also, I wore my EVMavricks t-shirt especially for this episode!

Meanwhile, in NFT-land...

Blur, the incumbent NFT marketplace, just [announced Blend](https://twitter.com/blur_io/status/1653101755809562624): a peer-to-peer lending and borrowing platform that lets users leverage their NFTs as collateral to borrow ETH. These loans are perpetual (no expiration price or date), at fixed rate. The twist? Lenders can call the loan at any time, triggering a Dutch auction for a new lender to step in and take over the loan.

But wait, there's more! Blend also [announced a Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) feature](https://mirror.xyz/blurdao.eth/ZieWXcPU3Td_8Ipozx9hw0atASKyjY7WlF1mZiANf0w), enabling users to "buy" their favourite NFTs with just a 20% down payment, while the rest is borrowed from a lending pool. I wrote "buy", because until the price is paid in full, the user can't do anything with the NFT, except for listing it in Blur's marketplace (ie try to sell it back and profit from the move).

As always, with great financialization comes even greater risks. Borrowing ETH to "buy" an NFT (BNPL) means going long on leverage (you profit if the price of the NFT rises). Borrowing an NFT and immediately sell it for ETH (Blend) means leveraging short (you profit if price falls). The result: when NFT values fluctuate in the opposite of the "expected" direction, users will quickly face liquidations.

We will soon see the impact of this development on collection prices. While leverage markets can help stabilise price fluctuations, they can also create massive liquidation cascades, so I'd expect some days of wild rides are ahead.

As I mentioned in the previous day it was 1 year in NFTs for me a few days ago and I'm taking that opportunity to reflect on the last year (& maybe a bit more) and on a variety of topics and experiences. I'm also going to repost them here and maybe something resonates here and there. Of course, I'm starting it with Ethfinance!

[1 Year in NFTs: Ethfinance](https://imgur.com/z2jXfi4)

I start my reflecting on 1 Year in NFTs from Ethfinance.

r/Ethfinance - subreddit that has influenced my Ethereum journey greatly, and thus - my NFT journey. 

But how is it exactly connected?

I've heard more and more about Ethereum as some of my online internet friends started exploring other chains besides bitcoin. Ethereum was one of the most promising ones. Eventually I ended up hearing more and more about it and I thought it was time to start looking into it. I do not remember exactly how but I did find r/ethfinance sometime in the middle of 2020. 

The discussion was amazing compared to the r/ bitcoinmarket's daily that I had been frequenting for years. Not only people were talking about the tech, it was the majority of the talk there. Quite a contrast compared to only 'number go up' in the btc daily.

Fast forward to March 2022, there's now talks about this NFT project - EVMavericks. Most active people where whitelisted. I had not. Why? Even though I'd been quite a frequent visitor - I was a lurker. Luckily, I made a few comments over the few years and that was enough to get on an additional list and then winning a raffle solidified my involvement. 

Nowadays I still visit the Ethfinance daily, almost on a daily basis. Sometimes I get too busy with life. It's still a wonderful place to ask questions, hear about new developments, be alerted about important topics, see the stories of community members and learn something new everyday.

After being one of the most active members in the EVMavericks discord and being still quite a strong lurker and even turning into a slight poster on Ethfinance, I can share a few of my observations. 

I personally prefer the pace of the discord as it's more of a live chat and closer to a real time conversation. Ethfinance has a higher quality and lower noise. Yet it doesn't do one thing very well for me and I'd bet especially for the people who are lurking - involving you in being part of the community. You see, sometimes folks like me who are new and not technical have really nothing substantial to contribute. And even though some of us are still asking some questions from time to time which I believe are still valuable contributions, it just does not complete the puzzle. And I believe each of us has something to offer and we can learn something new from each other. And this is where discord comes in and that is what it allows you to do, and I feel that EVMavericks degen chat, in particular, is prime example of bringing folks together. It's a glue. Still maybe for some but not others. 

Now I'm not going to go into pros and cons of each platform but one more thing I will mention is that the subreddit is a nice free resource for new folks. And I feel the vibe is especially geared for people who are, hopefully, going to make it financially as well as being the ones who are understanding and embracing many aspects of the technology and tools that we discover and build. 

Next up: reflecting on EVMavericks.

[1 Year in NFTs: Twitter Followers (4/21/2022-present)](https://imgur.com/Ulr1FWP)

I never really cared about Twitter prior to this point. I created an IRL account like 10ish years ago but never really used it. When it comes to crypto, most of my time was spent on Reddit - r/ethfinance.

Now, I'm not sure why I created this account, but it seems to be a day after I minted my Maverick. I know there's usually lots of excitement during the early days (the honey moon phase), and people were eager to bond together and roar about the lion pride. Anyway, I ended up creating an account and following all the Mavs the EVMavericks account was following. One thing that was still weird to me is that so many web3 or crypto projects use Twitter, which is a full web2 platform that can and has rugged some of my friends' accounts before. My account has been locked multiple times for no reason until you add your phone number, etc. to unlock it. One click on their end - you are gone.

Over time, and after getting more into ENS, I started caring more. I've changed sides of caring and not caring so many times now that I don't remember all the details, but I do know the important parts. What I've come to and what I hold nowadays is that I am able to hold both of the sides of caring and not caring at the same time. I personally don't care about it at all. When I'm in nature, when I'm doing things outside, when I'm engaged in the things that matter, and so on and on and on.

The nuance comes in because part of me does care. It does care for a very noble, specific set of reasons too. In the world where I do have more followers, I would be able to spread my values, educational messages, and even some funny memes to a wider range of people. All of that is nice, and yet it's important to let go of all of that. Otherwise, it alters my behavior in a way where it's still geared a bit more towards getting better numbers, while still keeping my true values. But then I wonder, and I like challenging myself with the question, "Why does a number of followers impact the content?".

"If I am doing something good, wouldn't it matter whether one or a thousand people see that?"

Again, there are, at least, two sides to the coin that I'm holding. And at the end of the day, I'm still human, and it does get very demoralizing to see all the people doing scammy (all other types of things) having more followers and more impact, which I judge as a net negative.

And why am I building in the first place?

I thought having a personal blog is nice addition that is like a journal, a resume, and basically an on-chain history of your identity. It seems we are not there in crypto, so that's why I'm still using Twitter, as it does matter, but also playing around more with web3 projects like mirror.xyz and paragraph.xyz. Also, building on top of ENS, even something as simple as a site - 696.eth.limo, is a way of doing that.

Honestly, there's still so much more to write about followers and how I have figured out some particular nuances, but, again, it doesn't really matter to me at the end of the day.

Although I'd say I have tried to be consistent on a daily basis for almost a year, maybe missing a bit in the beginning, and have contributed content in a variety of forms, including memes, threads, questions, observations, analysis, videos, news, step-by-step guides, etc and I have gotten to 2275 followers. That's also including all my NFT related communities and ENS.

I'd like to end it on a note that's future-focused. What am I going to do going forward?

Obviously, I don't have enough reach, and that's also a good thing for me mentally, as it gives me so much more room to experiment and make mistakes.

The most important to me is to be true to my values and certain things like curiosity, decentralization, community, collaboration, communication, transparency, education, and making people smile and laugh. All of that while being authentic, having a better balance on how this piece fits within my life puzzle. Focusing on my connections with people and on the effort that I'm putting in, and the content I'm creating than [being a slave to the algorithm.](https://imgur.com/dggpWLe)

<summary>u/Ethical-trade reviews RocketPool's Atlas upgrade in the days since it went live</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12vwbun/comment/jhdmsg3/)

Here's a Rocket Pool update since Atlas / LEB8 went live.

The minipool (RP's validator) count went up from shy of 14,000 to 15,329 today. Since 16eth pools can be divided into 2 leb8 pools, total count goes up, not much of a surprise here. Roughly +10% in 5 days.

More interestingly, node count went up as well from 2,291 to 2,393 which is a clear uptick that can be seen in [this chart](https://rocketscan.io/nodes). More nodes is what we decentralization maxis should be all about (and what I'm all about), so this is absolutely great news. According to [Etherscan's node count](https://etherscan.io/nodetracker), there are currently 9,170 Ethereum nodes.

**Rocket Pool now accounts for more than 1/4 of all Ethereum nodes. With a market share of only 2.7% of validators.**

I haven't found any reliable chart updated with Atlas but from my observation of the total number of eth staked from the [official website](https://rocketpool.net/#header), there's been roughly 3,000 eth poured into RP daily since the update. That's $5 million per day.

Before Atlas, the deposit pool was continuously full (meaning reth was highly in demand, never available) causing [a premium on the price](https://dune.com/mellamopablo/reth-premium). Today it's the opposite, there are many minipools waiting so the deposit pool is close to empty. In other words, many node operators are waiting for people to swap to reth. The premium is almost gone.

There are currently [21,870 reth worth $43 million waiting to be picked](https://portfolio.metamask.io/stake).

I'm expecting some whales to swallow a lot soon, and secretly hoping for Vitalik to swap some eth for reth. Would be crazy publicity for RP. Next time he does an AMA I'd like to ask him what he dislikes the most about Rocket Pool, I'm very curious to know his opinion.

In other great news, Rocket Pool's reth is now more profitable than Lido's steth, making it [the default option to stake from Metamask](https://portfolio.metamask.io/stake).

Rocket Pool is currently ranked [\#11 by TVL on Ethereum](https://defillama.com/chain/Ethereum) with a TVL of $1.37B and it looks like it will enter the top 10 in a few days.

I've probably missed some key data and would love to hear more!

Disclosure: Rocket Pool enthusiast here, rpl is my second largest holding after eth and approximately 25% of my total net worth.

<summary>u/nikola_j explains an interesting tidbit about EOAs and smart wallets</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12vwbun/daily_general_discussion_april_23_2023/jher94h/)

Hey, mate, one of the defi saver team members here.

Not sure which protocol you're considering using there specifically - is it Aave?

If yes, then that means that a position created on a smart wallet using defi saver would not be visible or manageable in the default frontend available att app. aave. com.

Why is that? Well, interacting with all these different protocols directly through an EOA (your standard Ethereum account) is the default approach in most cases (e.g. Aave, Compound, Liquity). This is mostly for simplicity reasons and gas savings.

However, a standard Ethereum account is currently limited in terms of how many smart contract interactions can be called within a single transaction.

This is why we chose to use the smart wallet as default for holding positions of each protocol we integrate at defi saver.

Main reason? The smart wallet provides a new layer of execution that has no limitations that a standard Ethereum account does. That's why we have options such as 1-tx leveraging/deleveraging, collateral and debt swaps, 1-tx moving of active positions between supported protocols, as well as a number of automation options for all protocols.

This short article in our knowledge base has a brief intro to the smart wallet: [https://help.defisaver.com/en/general/what-is-the-smart-wallet](https://help.defisaver.com/en/general/what-is-the-smart-wallet) 

If there's anything else I can clarify, please do let me know, would be glad to help.

**tl;dr:** If you open an (e.g.) Aave position on a smart wallet using defi saver, it won't be accessible through their frontend at aave. com. All exactly same protocol rules and rates apply in both cases, but their frontend only supports positions sitting on EOAs.

<summary>u/ArcadesOfAntiquity discusses an underrated type of cold wallet</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12x3uzq/daily_general_discussion_april_24_2023/jhi0715/)

Hey folks, just popping in to say: air-gapped QR code-based signers are vastly underrated as a crypto wallet security solution. (I'll refer to this tech as AGQR for the sake of brevity.)

I finally took the trouble to switch my wallets over to AGQR in the wake of the mysterious wave of wallet drainings that Twitter has been [abuzz](https://twitter.com/tayvano_/status/1648187031468781568) about.

**How do AGQR signers work?**

1. Similar to dedicated hardware wallets, you create a new seed on the signer device itself. (You can also import an existing seed.) You store a backup of the seed you created in the same way you usually would/should: always by writing it down, never by printing/screenshotting.
2. Your private key is held on the signer device--in my case I'm using an old Android phone running the free, open source Airgap.it Vault software. (I know, it might sound risky to keep your private key on a phone, but if you're cautious enough not to trust airplane mode, you could physically shield, remove, or otherwise disable the wifi, bluetooth, and cellular radios.)
3. On a separate, networked device (PC/laptop/tablet/other phone), wallet software such as Metamask suggests a transaction in the way we're familiar with, but when you click "Accept", instead of signing the transaction itself, it displays a QR code containing the parameters of the transaction.
4. You scan this code using your AGQR signer device, and then authorize signing on the device itself, using whatever security features the device has--PIN number, pattern drawing, fingerprint, etc. Again this is similar to dedicated hardware wallets, but here there is no physical connection between the two devices. (Hence the term "air-gapped"... which is probably a rather old security term, and makes less sense now that wireless networking is pervasive, but I digress.)
5. After you authorize, your AGQR device signs the transaction data and displays it on-screen in the form of a QR code.
6. You then hold the screen of the AGQR device up to a webcam attached to the networked device that first suggested the transaction, and it reads the QR code and broadcasts the signed transaction to the Ethereum network.

It might sound like a hassle but the whole process takes about one minute when you get used to it.

**Why not just use a hardware wallet like Trezor, Ledger, Lattice, etc?**

1. Owning a hardware wallet makes it obvious that you're into crypto. For those of us who would rather keep it discrete, an old phone wins hands down. The hw wallet companies seem to really disregard this segment of the market. Case in point, the new "fashion" Ledger wallets that you wear on a chain around your neck. Thanks but no thanks.
2. Personal information exposure risk. Buying a hardware wallet potentially creates a record of your name/address/phone number/credit card number being associated with cryptocurrency. This could be no big deal, or it could be a huge deal in the case of the Ledger customer data leak. Buying a phone creates no such risk. In fact...
3. You probably already own an old phone. If not you can buy one cheaper than you can a hw wallet.
4. Phones are mass-produced consumer technology. We could argue that hardware wallets have become this too, but which is easier to quickly replace, repair, or troubleshoot? Definitely the phone, in my opinion.
5. No custom firmware/drivers. It seems like every few weeks there are new headaches and incompatibilities based on faulty or late firmware/drivers.

**Downsides?**

1. Since it's just (free) software that runs on a phone, it doesn't create any revenue for the people that make it. Therefore if there are future changes to Ethereum's transaction data format, updates to the AGQR signer software could be slow or even, worst-case, non-existent. However, the software I'm using is open source, so I wouldn't expect it to be a problem for long, if at all.
2. For the same reason, the supported range of phones might not be the best. The software installed on my old Galaxy S6, but wouldn't launch properly. 
3. For the same reason, customer service/support might also be bare-bones or non-existent. I haven't checked yet.
4. Not many people are using it, as far as I know, so you won't be able to Google for answers as easily. But hopefully as awareness of how effective this tech is, this situation will change! Indeed, that's part of the reason I'm posting this.

**Summary and Conclusion**

I'm aware I'm maybe honeymooning over it, but I'm strongly tempted to say the AGQR signer is "the way": it has basically all the benefits of a hardware wallet and basically none of the drawbacks. It's portable, small, and self-contained, without notifying everyone that you're into crypto, and if it breaks, no big deal, you can get a new one the next day.

Trying to think about it more objectively, I know some people are likely to feel that AGQR on an old phone is a bit too "DIY" to trust their money with it. That's understandable, but on the other hand, I figure a lot of us here already have a pretty DIY attitude if we're willing to hold our own keys in the first place.

In conclusion, I think there will always be a market for dedicated hardware wallets, as a "no compromises" type, maximum security, industrial-grade solution. However, for most of us, I think AGQR fits the needs of the user so much better that it's not even close. Especially if you tend to think things should be open source and self-hosted, you owe it to yourself to explore this tech.

TLDR: I'm loving my AGQR setup and just wanted to let everyone here know about it.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12x3uzq/daily_general_discussion_april_24_2023/jhhxhlh/)

Here is a proposed public good that I think we could bootstrap through this community or EVMavericks.

A curated white-list of trust-worthy smart contract addresses. Plus a browser extension that relies on it and lets you know whenever you are interacting with a smart contract that it's a know and trustworthy one and warns you when it's an unknown one.

In the future this whitelist could hopefully be integrated in other wallets, MetaMask, frame.sh, etc...

[u/LeagueGreedy](https://reddit.com/u/LeagueGreedy):

It feels so good to have fully minted out Withdrowls and start the public goods funding buidlathon!  It makes me so happy to see community come together to support a great cause!

Some fun facts about Withdrowls: it was 4 days from idea to mint out. Marketing started the day after we decided this was something we wanted to do, so only 48 hours of marketing before mint. It also only took 24 hours to mint out! Oh, and about 95% of the tweets were automated, that was a lot of fun.

We jammed A LOT into those 4 days so please give [u/etheraider](https://reddit.com/u/etheraider) a hug next time you see them, and please sign up; all ideas are welcome :)

Feel free to hijack this comment's replies if you don't have an idea, but would like to team up with a community member!

<summary>u/LogrisTheBard talks more on human coordination</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12z6zsm/daily_general_discussion_april_26_2023/jhr4hui/)

I've written before about crypto and [Human Coordination](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/human-coordination/) and why it is my favorite leg of The Rabbit Hole. A lot of the work to date on this topic is on deciding relative balances of power between key actors via token distributions, identifying all the necessary actors of a system and ensuring they are fairly compensated and cannot profit from misbehavior (incentive alignment), and creating systems to encourage voter participation such as delegation and bribe systems. There is an implicit step before all of that wherein an organization needs to agree on what it is trying to achieve and critically *how* it should go about achieving it. This is the value alignment process, it is a never-ending affair, and it's a predecessor to all other actions of an organization.

Once upon a time in MakerDAO, after a black swan event wiped out many of their early users, the DAO was faced with a decision on whether to reimburse those affected. They decided not to. They then had to decide what was more important between peg stability and decentralization. They chose peg stability and created the Peg Stability Module (PSM). To this day I still disagree with both of those decisions but regardless of how I feel the DAO had to wrestle with controversial values, reach a consensus, and then act. How to enshrine values into a system varies greatly by each system but I think it's worth reviewing some of the methods we've seen so far, what is good and bad about them, and how we might be able to improve upon them.

Some systems are able to enshrine their values in code. For example Ethereum, when forced to tackle the [scalability trilemma](https://chainstack.com/solving-the-blockchain-trilemma-scaling-solutions-for-ethereum/), chose decentralization and security over scalability. These values are encoded in the gas market and block sizes. Solana went the other path. Earlier in its history Ethereum was forced to choose between finality and ethics (look up Ethereum Classic). We chose ethics. Judging by the relative adoption of Ethereum vs Ethereum Classic this was apparently the more widely supported choice by a majority of node owners, app developers, and companies. Behind these decisions is what we commonly call Layer 0. This is one of the most fragile parts of the Ethereum ecosystem and one that we have to maintain constant vigilance on. The value alignment process for Ethereum can basically be described as a vacuum where a process should be. How does one become part of the Layer 0 set of actors? Basically you post in Ethfinance, attend events like Hodlercon, meet/influence the right people, attend core dev calls, write ERCs, etc. You go down The Rabbit Hole and get *involved*.

In more traditional power structures where value alignment decides the strategy of something but not necessarily its implementation it is more normal for the value alignment process to take place by delegation and hierarchical decomposition. It is infeasible to coordinate an organization the size of a nation state using an open mic system or social media upvotes. So we tackle this complexity using walled gardens and hierarchies. Within a corporation the primary organization of this hierarchy is what I refer to as the [pyramid of subordination](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/TradiCorporateStructure.png). This structure prevents bystander syndrome by assigning accountability for each task, ensures each person is qualified for the job using a social attestation system in the local vicinity of the pyramid (interviews), and generally organizes people to act towards a unified goal. It is efficient when done well. The military uses a similar structure for the same reasons. It also doubles as a more efficient value alignment system than I've seen in DAOs. When there is disagreement this structure provides an escalation process amongst direct reports, peers, and superiors within the pyramid of subordination. If a matter isn't satisfactorily resolved by those initially involved, it escalates up to the C-level personnel who serve as the ultimate authority for the values of the organization. By the time it reaches them, there are almost certainly multiple valid strategies that could be taken that they are deciding between. This is actually the primary value of C-level personnel; they embody the values of an organization.

So what are the problems with this design? What are we hoping to improve with web3 technologies? Well, the problem begins just above the pyramid of subordination. As we‚Äôve seen in the US in the past 50 years, using highly liquid capital as the ultimate authority source in the system has led to the pursuit of short-term profits at the detriment of all other factors. Shareholders care about their share price and dividends above all other factors and so they appoint C-level personnel and structure their compensation to reflect this desire. As a result companies destroy the environment, have little to no regard for their employees well-being, subjugate their local communities, pursue one merger and acquisition after another in order to form too-big-to-fail monopolies, and exploit every financial and political system they can to stifle competition and create power imbalances in their favor. From a game theory perspective this is the expected outcome of this design. It is Moloch in action, as our society increasingly organizes itself into these ever growing capital-hungry behemoths. You would think companies would be beholden to customers but the customer has no influence in this power structure other than to take business elsewhere. Sadly, working to stifle competition and reduce customer choice is often more effective for companies than working to improve the customer experience or provide a better product. So, the first thing to improve is to create structures for value alignment that are able to embody a wider diversity of values without sacrificing organizational efficiency.

The second thing to improve is resilience. This structure is fallible to key-man syndrome. It is optimized for efficiency not resilience. When one person has the full autonomy to do something it becomes ripe for corruption and/or enforcement pressures. The larger the set of people that need to consent to something the harder it becomes to form a conspiracy to make any decision that does not align with the DAO consensus mission.

If we can only succeed at improving these two facets of organizations, crypto would already be a world-altering, indispensable technology. But we are working on so much more than that. We are working on ways to divorce capital from influence, remove the walled garden around the value alignment system, fight any and all forms of coordination failures, and novel ways of incentive alignment that can change human behavior at scale so that our societal values more closely align with those of our dominant power structures. It is basically impossible to be against this ethically once you understand it. The most bullish thing for Ethereum is to be understood.

<summary>u/Hocilef shares an underrated protocol</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12z6zsm/daily_general_discussion_april_26_2023/jhrphbf/)

I have came across an interesting protocol called Sismo enabling users to manage their various digital indentities privately using zk-badges.

As hinted, it uses zero-knowledge proofs. If you are not familiar with these, this video shared multiple times in the daily was very helpful (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOGdb1CTu5c). Basically, it is a mathematical tool allowing to selectively reveal a piece of data. Applying these to digital identity, you can aggregate valuable characteristics from different account (web2) or ethereum wallet without revealing their adresses. 

For instance, let say you have a wallet with which you gave a lot to Gitcoin grant and another one with a high degen score. You want to aggregate theses characteristics in a third without giving your history (adresses). Sismo allows you to do this. Practically, you connect your different wallets to their apps, create signatures and mint "zk-badges". A badge is a non-transferable/soulbound token (NT-ERC1155).

From their docs (https://docs.sismo.io/sismo-docs/):

> Users aggregate their identity in Sismo‚Äôs Data Vault and start accumulating Data Gems‚Äîatomic pieces of data that categorize users into groups. In turn, users can generate proofs to make claims about their data (e.g, I own a specific NFT). These proofs are verified by applications‚Äîeither on-chain or off-chain. The resulting privacy-preserving attestations‚Äîstored in on-chain smart contracts or off-chain databases‚Äîare utilized by applications for access control and reputation curation.Users aggregate their identity in Sismo‚Äôs Data Vault and start accumulating Data Gems‚Äîatomic pieces of data that categorize users into groups.

<summary>u/nixorokish celebrates u/Benjamin Chodroff's great work to save over 2000 compromised validators</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12kcm3z/daily_general_discussion_april_13_2023/jg5ex6s/)

Dunno if anyone's mentioned this yet, but CLWP (EIP-4736) included 2,133 potentially or definitely compromised validators who were racing to set their withdrawal address before a hacker could.

Of those 2133 in the set, 2133 were able to set their address to one controlled by the rightful owner. 100% success rate. *Not a single one* to a hacker.

Benjamin Chodroff (and Jim McDonald, I shouldn't have omitted that) was the author and did a seriously amazing job after realizing that his own seed for his validators were compromised and, instead of giving up and leaving the space, found a way to save not just his own, but thousands of others. Seriously amazing job.

<summary>u/domotheus and u/geoffbezos discuss EIP-4844/Danksharding</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12jan7l/daily_general_discussion_april_12_2023/jfzwpos/)

[u/domotheus](https://reddit.com/u/domotheus):

Imagine you go to the Apples and Oranges Store because you need some oranges. But the store owner is quirky and has a rule that goes "This store will only sell 1000 total items per day. Whether that's 1 apple and 999 oranges, or 900 apples and 100 oranges, or a perfect split I don't care. Once I sold my 1000th item I'm done for the day."

Also, this store's apples are very good. People drive from all over the place to buy them. So naturally since supply is low and demand is high, so the cost of apples go up and the store owner makes a killing selling them. Oranges, on the other hand, aren't as popular. On average, the store owner sells about 980 apples and 20 oranges every day.

You personally don't really care that much about the apples, you want to buy oranges. But due to the store's weird rule, you still have to outbid people looking to buy to buy apples. Oranges should be cheap because they are plentiful and in low demand, but every orange you buy is an apple someone else can't buy. After the store sold 999 items that day, why would he sell you an orange for $1 when someone's willing to buy an apple for $10? You'll have to offer at least $10 to get the orange you want.

"This is really dumb", you think to yourself. You talk to the store owner and make him come to his senses, and he agrees to change his stupid rule. Now he'll sell at most 1000 apples per day *and* at most 100 oranges per day. So now that the two supply/demand markets are separated, an apple can cost $10 and the orange can cost $1 and everybody's happy - you get cheap oranges, and the store owner gets more money (1000 x $10 + 200 x $1 gets him more money than the previous system when $10 was the cost of an *item* and he sold 1000)

Back in Ethereum land the apple represent *execution* (the gas that affects state, compute stuff in the EVM, etc.) and oranges represent *data* (the gas that stores stuff in the chain's history). Rollups do their execution off-chain, so what they need most from Layer 1 is data. Today the cheapest solution is using call data at 16 gas per byte. But if everyone's fighting to do EVM stuff, the cost of that 16 gas/bytes goes up as well because there's only so much gas in each block. This really shouldn't be the case, since data is a different resource from execution.

So what EIP4844 does is separate those two resources into two distinct markets: The gas market as we know it today stays the same, and there's a new "data gas" resource with its own pricing that happens separately. Rollups will be happy because now they get to commit their batches on chain in these nifty new things called "blobs", and when demand for blobs is low, blobs will be cheap ¬≠‚Äî even if there's a huge NFT drop going on that brings gas to 500 gwei

On a technical level it does other cool things in preparation for full danksharding later on, which will allow a significant increase in the size of blobs so that it becomes even cheaper for rollups to commit data to blobs. But even without danksharding, just splitting the markets will help drastically lower fees on rollups, which will be nice.

[Yesterday](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12jan7l/daily_general_discussion_april_12_2023/jfzrdc2/) I asked about how EIP 4844 aka proto-danksharding works.

I got some really good answers so decided to sum it up, I put together a [thread](https://twitter.com/0xjaypeg/status/1646550326965862400) with an ELI5 on how danksharding works. TL;DR for those that don't want to click into twitter:

- ETH txns vary across "complexity" (complexity measures gas)
- Txn "complexity" is split between "execution" vs. "data"
- Currently "execution" and "data" are sold via the same gas market
- Danksharding splits up these up so there's a "data gas" market
- "Data gas" market sells "data" via "blobs"
- L2s benefit since the txns they post to mainnet have a lot of "data" complexity 
- The implication is that L2 txn costs won't be as impacted by ETH mainnet activity (big NFT mint, airdrop claim event)

<summary>u/Ender985 shares some NFT drama that reminds us about the importance of immutability</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12lkn8x/daily_general_discussion_april_14_2023/jg7my5f/)

Meanwhile, in post-Shapella NFT-land..

The whole point of crypto is trustlessness and code-is-law. As a consequence, NFTs are immutable.

Well, it turns out that sometimes they are not.

Truth Labs, the org behind Goblintown profile picture NFTs, suddenly changed the jpegs of their all NFT collections to a.. middle finger with more middle fingers, with the text: "Fuck royalties. Fuck supporting builders and creatives. Flipping is the heart of what makes web3 special. Honor the flipper, fuck the community. Long live the slow rug!" [Check for yourselves](https://opensea.io/collection/goblintownwtf). 

This move is part of their migration to new contracts, probably to enforce royalties on-chain. As you know, the Blur vs OpenSea feud caused a race to the bottom on "off-chain" royalties.

Truth Labs still had access to the contracts able to change the metadata of their NFT collections, effectively giving them the power to change the jpeg that the NFT represents. This took many holders by surprise, since they thought their NFTs were immutable.. Well now they need to trust that Truth Labs will change their jpegs back.

There is a lesson to be learned here. Even if a web3 participant understands the underlying technology, and the principles of trustlessness and immutability on which crypto is founded, they still can be caught in a trap. Smart contracts are law, but sometimes this law is not what we think it is.

[u/Dont_Waver](https://reddit.com/u/Dont_Waver):

It means that if someone is being charged by the SEC, and that person claims that the SEC is acting unconstitutionally, that person doesn't have to wait until the SEC is done with the enforcement action to appeal in court.

Administrative groups, such as the SEC, are part of the executive branch of the government, but they have a sort of judicial power in enforcing the regulations that they were formed to enforce. So previously, you would have to wait until they were done with their investigation and enforcement action before you could appeal to a court. However, if you are arguing that the SEC doesn't have constitutional authority to enforce whatever it is they're trying to do to you, it's kind of silly to have to wait for them to finish the whole investigation and enforcement action before you can object and appeal.

For the SEC, this means that if, for example, Coinbase was charged in an enforcement action by the SEC and Coinbase wanted to argue that the SEC doesn't have the power to regulate crypto under their grant of power, it could immediately appeal to a federal or state court and have this argument ruled on. This would save a ton of time and money if the court finds that the SEC doesn't have that power.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12mqnlc/daily_general_discussion_april_15_2023/jgfzula/)

So there's this idea I've been wanting to try for a while now.

You guys know how Ethernodes is notoriously bad at showing how many actual execution nodes there are? And so we don't have any real sense of how many there might be? I even see some discussion farther down the daily today on that subject.

I think we here in EthFinance/EthStaker might be uniquely well-placed to answer that question: how many nodes *are* there on Ethereum? Basically, a bunch of us who run nodes (including execution clients) would go and look up our node by IP address or public key on ethernodes.org. Then we'd each just reply to the comment/thread/whatever with a simple "yes" or "no", depending on whether Ethernodes knew about our node.

With a big enough sample size, like dozens or ideally a few hundred+, we'd start to get a pretty clear picture of how many actual nodes there are out there.

Example: Ethernodes claims there are 7500 nodes on a particular day. When 100 of us check our nodes that day, only 25% show up on Ethernodes. Conclusion: There are actually 30k nodes, give or take some error bar that I'm sure the stats majors here could figure out (i.e. not me :P )

Thoughts?

<summary>u/BuyETHorDAI discusses an anti-crypto podcast which reminds us that the most bullish thing for Ethereum is to be understood.</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12nw0o0/daily_general_discussion_april_16_2023/jghox4h/)

Anyone watch Bill Maher? One his guests wrote an anti-crypto book, and I just found the arguments in their interview funny.  I think the interview just furthers my view that Ethereum needs to dissasociate itself from the word cryptocurrency. I would much rather see the word cryptonetwork as it conveys that currency is not a central theme. But anyways I summarized the interview because I think this is a great summary of the mainstream opinion on "crypto".

- Cryptocurrencies aren't currencies and never will be (defined as store of value, medium of exchange, unit of account)
- Centralized exchanges should be regulated like banks
- If money is trust, then the term trustless money is nonsense. It's like saying a government-less government, or religion-less religion. 
- cryptocurrencies are not money, they are investments for higher returns which makes them a security
- The only people that use them are crminals and gamblers because its inherently a zero-sum game because cryptocurrencies don't do anything. Usually a security is a share of a stock, but with crypto there's no product, there's no good, or service, which is why it's a zero sum game where for someone to win, someone has to lose
- Crypto is a ponzi scheme because a million people can't access their money out of FTX
- If you lose your "pin number" in crypto, then you're just fucked and there's nothing you can do which is why people use exchanges so that someone else is reponsible for your shit
- Most centralized exchanges are fake and eventually collapse
- NFTs are a ponzi scam / right click save / jpgs / wash trading / goodluck selling your bored ape
- The amount of energy for "blockchains" is ridiculous. In 2021, Bitcoin and "other cryptocurrencies" mined a ton of energy.

These are almost verbatim the arguments thrown around. The first thing I notice is that if you replace the word cryptocurrency with Bitcoin, it makes a lot more sense. The arguments are very surface level and lack a ton of nuance because in the maintreams eyes, cryptocurrencies are all like Bitcoin. I think the old saying around here absolutely applies. The most bullish thing about Ethereum is to be understood.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12nw0o0/daily_general_discussion_april_16_2023/jgjy13h/)

Now that withdrawals are enabled with the successful upgrade of Shapella, I'm keeping an eye out for institutions and big movers. 

Already this year we've seen [Fidelity and Blackrock](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/03/21/14-trillion-earthquake-fidelity-and-blackrock-are-quietly-laying-the-groundwork-for-the-next-bitcoin-ethereum-and-crypto-price-bull-run/?sh=41e77f2a6759) pouring funds into Blockchain. 

NASDAQ in their [Digital Assets Business is expected](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/nasdaq-eyeing-q2-2023-release-for-bitcoin-and-crypto-custody-platform) to start providing customer crypto custody by the end of June after receiving approval from the New York Department of Financial Services. Much like Fidelity, the platform will function similar to an exchange with liquidity and execution services. 

Just last year [Bank of America reported](https://newsroom.bankofamerica.com/content/newsroom/press-releases/2022/10/bank-of-america-private-bank-study-finds-younger-investors-turni.html) a turning signal for wealthy investors away from the stock market and into Crypto, Real Estate, and Private Equity.

>"75% of young investors say it‚Äôs impossible to achieve above-average returns solely with traditional stocks and bonds."

Combine this sentiment with the economic slowdown and credit crisis, crypto investments are in better position this year.

Also, and not the news I expected to see gain traction and excitement, but the Bank of America is reporting some interesting drivers of recent digital asset adoption from gold:

[Tokenized gold](https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2023/04/16/bank-of-america-reveals-surprise-crypto-key-driver-amid-300-billion-bitcoin-ethereum-bnb-xrp-cardano-dogecoin-polygon-and-solana-price-boom/?sh=35b657842956) passed $1 billion in value last month under the market cap pump of stablecoins PAXG and tether gold XAUT. 

> "Tokenized gold provides exposure to physical gold, 24/7 real-time settlement, no management fees and no storage or insurance costs. The low minimum investment increases accessibility and fractionalization enables the transfer of physical gold ownership and value that was not previously possible."

We could all do with some peace of mind and stability after all the black swans we've experienced last year. Here's to hoping that these large institutions don't exert regulatory and market forces in the wrong direction and fuck it up for the rest of us.

<summary>u/Jin366 digs up something from YouTube covering AI and Ethereum</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12p2uhe/daily_general_discussion_april_17_2023/jglfue6/)

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uN3DP-40TA4&t=2380s>

This is a gem of a channel. He talks about autonomous AI and how Ethereum might play an important role in the future AI economy. Really good. 

This is the part where he speaks about AI economy (and Ethereum):

"Now, I will discuss the integration of these AI models into the legacy financial system and Ethereum. These models can function as a central brain and connect to other neural networks, AI systems, and handcrafted intelligence systems like Wolfram Alpha. As the AI assistant interacts with apps and handles tasks for you, there will be a need for it to manage money.

In the first iteration, AI will interact with apps to book flights, for example, and users will confirm and approve transactions. As the AI becomes more effective and trusted, users will want it to handle more tasks autonomously, including financial transactions.

There will be pressure to integrate AI into financial systems, but this may create friction in the traditional financial system. These autonomous AI entities might face difficulties meeting regulatory expectations because the legacy system is governed by regulations designed for humans. Additionally, the traditional financial system is not well-suited for global transactions between AI agents due to regional differences.

Crypto systems like Ethereum, on the other hand, are well-suited for autonomous systems. Ethereum was designed with the idea that autonomous agents might conduct much of the financial activity in the future. It is permissionless, global, transparent, and digital-native, making it an ideal platform for AI agents to manage accounts and interact with smart contracts.

Though most economic activity still occurs in the traditional financial system, friction in that system may push AI agents towards crypto systems like Ethereum. Smart contracts on Ethereum can be used to coordinate AI agents, creating a seamless environment for AI-driven financial transactions."

Patrick McHenry did a FANTASTIC job with Gensler today. I believe he really forced the issue on Ethereum as a Commodity and hope it leads to regulatory movement (but maybe we in the U.S. shouldn't hold our collective breaths just yet with our painfully slow government, sigh). Anyway, g*reat job Rep McHenry!*

But damn, also McHenry (and I'll keep this REALLY brief): **votes against** Women's Health Protection, the Chips Act, the Infrustructure & Jobs Act, multiple bills protecting Queer rights, multiple bills protecting the right to vote, multiple bills to (can we please!) close assault weapon loopholes...

\*Okay, back to Ethereum. And yes I'm flying my 'Murica flag here today, so bare with us everyone around the globe :)

I've been thinking a lot about how Ethereum can be represented better in U.S. legislative process. Reps like McHenry & Emmer are (let me be mild here) faux "public servants." They have clear records of working against the Common Good. **Ethereum deserves better heroes.** I don't consider myself politically savvy and work in an unrelated field but am wondering what effective avenues would be worth my time and/or support. I have donated to Coincenter in the past and probably will again, ~~but I need to update myself on what they have been up to.~~ *Edited:* [*Coin Center works to educate policy makers.*](https://www.coincenter.org/blog/) *Recent efforts to educate involved the terrible "Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act," the "RESTRICT Act," and the Treasury's DeFi risk assessment. I hope to find out more about specific advocacy they are doing.*

Any other coalitions come to mind I need to become aware of? Any ideas perculating on effective organizing or lobbying for those of us who care about good ETH regulation? I would love to donate some time and energy to this, but not sure at this juncture what will make a difference.

P.S. Just so you know I'm not on some Lib high horse, I can't stand listening to Senator Warren talk either \*facepalm. Thanks for reading...

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12qb6uw/daily_general_discussion_april_18_2023/jgqarxi/)

For anyone worried, here are some wallet tips:

1. Keep your funds seperated if you have a lot of money. There have been plenty of cases of people accidentally signing fraudulent transactions even with a hardware wallet, because their PC was compromised. So don't mix your 100 Eth retirement money with your wallet containing dickbutt NFTs. Also if you interact with dodgy or untested contracts, use a seperate wallet for that too. 
1. For best security use a multisig wallet/social recovery or a hardware wallet
1. Wallet ‚â† wallet. Do your research, the more funds you have the more careful you should choose the wallet. They're all developed by different teams with different philosophies
1. No, HW wallets are not unhackable as some seem to think. There can be and have been plenty of bugs found in the code. The same goes for any wallet. There is no perfect security, know the risks. 
1. Revoke permissions!
1. Hackers aside, another maybe even more common way ppl lose funds is by their own error. Make sure you have the keys/recovery phrase properly backed up. There are a lot of different ways you could do that, spend some time reading up on it. Never upload it to any online machine or expose it to a camera connected to the internet. No cloud storage, no smartphone etc. Your private key must never get close to the internet! Obviously physical theft can also be a concern, although lesser. There are ways to greatly mitigate the risks of self custody, look into it.
1. If you're relatively new to all of this Andreas Antonopoulos has some great videos on wallet security etc. on Youtube. He mostly talks about Bitcoin but it's same same for beginners. It's important to know the basics.

Most of us recognize that the space has an overabundance of scams and theft. There is a clear distinction between private companies like FTX who offer a product with no transparency and a public ledger built on open source technology.

Last year, ethereum had a groundbreaking upgrade that reduced network energy consumption by almost a hundred percent by upgrading to proof of stake and eliminating the need for wasteful crypto mining. Hacked funds are often traced by the community with updates on activities broadcasted through social media and it‚Äôs quite common for the community to help its users get stolen funds back. There have also been millions of dollars donated in aid to Ukraine through cryptocurrency.

Reading many ppl here the last days that claim we are just greedy and only care about pumping our bags. **We aren't against regulation, we are against bad regulation.** If the SEC got its way, I predict that ETH would be a security that retail can't touch directly, only indirectly from various bank products. Private stable coins might be banned. Private wallets, or what they call them - unhosted wallets, wild wallets or dark wallets will be banned. Defi itself likely banned unless accessed from a bank that charges a fee, "for our protection".  

No other country is stuck on the question, whether ETH is a security or commodity. Crypto regulation in the UK and EU is not perfect but we realize that crypto is here to stay and put out regulation, guidelines and not just 55 litigations. I was positively surprised by how many Defi actions, my Nordic tax authority has provided guidelines on this year. ETH staking (cap. gains, not ordinary income), lending, LPing etc. Meanwhile, the US IRS hasn't even spoken about ETH staking. Most people will likely class it as ordinary income because that is safer than to classify as the lower taxed capital gains. 

SEC's actions are embarrassing (even Hester, Gensler's colleague says so), the IRS is embarrassing, the political dick swinging between agencies, embarrassing. R vs D as well and things like that make me lose faith in society and the democratic process more than any crypto scammer ever did. Scammers do it for the money, above, I think is done for the same or even worse reasons.

I deposited my ETH into the staking contract 871 days ago. Later, on 1 Dec 2020, Beacon Chain launched, and since then my solo staking rig has been running 24/7 with near perfect uptime. Total downtime amounts to probably less than half an hour. I've earned a nice amount in consensus and execution rewards.  Operationally it has cost me nearly nothing, about ¬£100-150 in electricity over the 2 or so years, and about 12 hours of my time. It runs in a fanless case, so I don't even hear it. I sometimes forget it even exists. It contributes to the Ethereum network and is a source of passive income that has truly no intrusion in my life. And yet, I can't wait to instantaneously exit all of my validators and dump all of my ETH later tonight.

<summary>u/Yeopaa shares a great personal story with thanks to this subreddit</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12d9ndu/daily_general_discussion_april_6_2023/jf7hy4w/)

Hello ethfam,

I'm going to try not to drag this out. Those of you that know little bits of my life from what I've shared here know that I first entered the ethereum space at the beginning of covid. I was supposed to fly from Ireland to the Philippines to finally marry my long term girlfriend of 13 years when covid put a two year halt on it. For those two years I saved like a motherfucker and invested hard into eth and its ecosystem. Initially with a percentage of money that was for a wedding, then ramping up the DCAs more and more over time.

Last May I celebrated my marriage in the Philippines here with all of you. It was a long time in the making.

Three months ago, after a long and arduous (and expensive + paper heavy) process, my wife and I managed to secure a spousal visa for her to come live with me.

And that brings us to about an hour ago - after three days of literally no sleep I've secured a property here for us. I'm not exaggerating when I say in this timeframe none of this would have been remotely possible without this subreddit. Ethfinance is the flame that keeps my passion burning. A massive thanks to Arbitrum for that ridiculous airdrop also. 

I'm proud to say that, thanks to this space, I will be flying out once more to the other side of the world next month for my 1 year anniversary, but this time my wife is finally coming back with me, with my surname, a secured visa and her name on a frankly beautiful and much too big property.

Thank you everyone. It's the next chapter for me. Now I can finally start planning for solo staking.

Keep 'er lit,

- Yeopaa.

<summary> u/696_eth introduces us to the ENS NameWrapper</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12eagbz/daily_general_discussion_april_7_2023/jfaaq5b/)

ENS NameWrapper that has been in works for years is going to be activated soon (within 24ish), [the vote has passed](https://www.tally.xyz/gov/ens/proposal/42973781582803845389836855775840822719678533376883030929209752909248937768242) and there is a 2 day time lock.

There's so much untapped potential in it so I'm very excited. And there's already many cool apps that are building on top or utilizing ENS, maybe I'll write about them later, big part of them are still in beta phases or are relatively new and small.

But the one cool thing I wanted to share that might be really useful to you now is this:

so you can create a subdomain aka child, so let's say using mine as an example, *evmaverick*.696.eth

but what might not be intuitive is that you can create a subdomain of that subdomain!

and that's how we get - *337*.evmaverick.696.eth (for context, 337 is my token ID of the lion)

and so on and on - ü¶Å.337.evmaverick.696.eth

Now you can just pick a domain (5 char+ for $5/y) and create subdomains for your vaults, your burner, hot and all other wallets while not paying any extra additional money since subdomains can be free, you only gotta renew your parent, which is 696.eth in my example. Of course, there's so much more options going to be available now cause of fuses (that's a big topic in itself).

<summary>u/FluffayPenguin has some critical wallet security advice</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12g9dz5/daily_general_discussion_april_9_2023/jfjkmym/)

Same thing I told the other sub:

**Don't rely on revokes**

It's good to check your revokes regularly using revoke.cash, but you shouldn't be relying on them.

The SushiSwap hack is one of those cases where a hardware wallet wouldn't have saved you, and revoking would've been too late.

**Using Minimum allowance is the Best Practice**

The best practice is to approve ONLY the exact amount of tokens you needed to make a swap so that once your swap is complete, the allowance automatically goes back down to 0.

* For example, if you approve 300 tokens and swap 250 tokens, your allowance for a particular spender goes down from 300 to 50 tokens after the swap
* So if you approve of 300 tokens and swap exactly 300 tokens, the allowance goes down to 0 and that router can't spend anymore.

I know it sucks to make a new approvals on L1 Ethereum where gas fees are expensive. But on cheaper networks, you really have no excuse.

Fortunately, many newer tokens allow permits instead of revokes, which combines an approval and transfer into 1 transaction.

Sad to see that the thing I warned people about 6 months ago finally happened.

After RCPSwap and SushiSwap first launched, I noticed that 99% of users were setting **unlimited approvals** and warned the community about it.

Back then, there were no front-end revoke tools for Arbitrum Nova like revoke.cash, and Metamask's approval UI was less transparent, so [I wrote a guide](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrencyMoons/comments/xzn3gj/how_to_revoke_unlimited_approval_on_arbitrum_nova/) on how revoke manually using the Moons contract.

<summary>u/LogrisTheBard talked crypto with the family at Easter</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12h7qgo/daily_general_discussion_april_10_2023/jfnvog9/)

I was talking with some family friends today for Easter brunch and, being polite, they asked me about some crypto topics. I ended up explaining the basics of lending in crypto which I'm going to paraphrase here. This is probably one of those things everyone here already knows but which might be useful if you ever need to explain this to someone outside this space.

There are three ways we facilitate lending in crypto today:

1) Overcollateralization. You post collateral worth more than what you're borrowing. In Tradfi this is basically the structure of every mortgage/car loan. You use the property you are buying as collateral for the mortgage itself. This works best for assets that are unlikely to sharply depreciate in value and put lenders underwater. In Defi, that property obviously doesn't hold so we add self-liquidating mechanisms to this system. If your collateral ever falls in value relative to your loan you forfeit the collateral to repay the debt automatically. We mostly use these loans for financial speculation or retaining price exposure to an asset while effectively selling some of it. 

2) Flash Loans. We let you borrow as much money as you want on the condition that you have to repay it instantly. I find this is the most confusing one to people at face value but it makes sense to most people when explained in terms of originating mortgages. Again, mortgages are overcollateralized loans. Without flashloans there is a bit of a chicken and egg problem where without the loan you can't buy the property and without the property you can't get the loan. In Tradfi they have an intermediary facilitate this by effectively granting you a short term loan. In Defi, that's just involving an unnecessary middleman so we dispense with it.

3) Leverage. You can use 1 ETH to buy 3 ETH and exaggerated effects as the price goes up and down. This is similar to overcollateralized lending except we don't actually *give you* the 3 ETH. It's held in escrow by some contract so you can't run away with it. In the example above if your collateral falls by 1/3 in value you get margin called and liquidated. This is really no different than how it works on traditional brokerages. The main difference with Defi is while things like naked shorting are *illegal* in Tradfi brokerages, they are *impossible* in Defi.

That leads us to the last form of debt most people know: uncollateralized lending based on credit. While there are some teams experimenting with this, we just can't bootstrap these systems effectively until we solve the problem of accountability. IRL it is both difficult and illegal to set up multiple identities. On blockchains it is trivial and there is no such thing as the police. If I am willing to give an anonymous stranger $10 on credit I at least need to know that if they rug me they can only do that *once*. That at least means I can only get rugged 7 billion times. Identity theft and fraud are already a problem in Tradfi. In Defi, the problem is so much worse that what you take for granted with a credit card today can't even get started. We may see a Tradfi equivalent to credit systems on a blockchain once a government decides to build a system to certify an identity on chain and integrate their legal system with smart contracts for enforcement but we'd really like to see a more decentralized approach.

There are numerous advantages to eventually solving this problem on the blockchain. For people with existing access to credit, a technology called zero knowledge proofs adds privacy protection so Experion doesn't repeatedly leak your personal data to identity thieves. Next, is consumer choice: the market would be free to create a much wider array of credit score services rather than the regulatory captured monopolies we have today. Last, ironically is scalability; not in transaction throughput but in customers. Right now credit services are available to a minority of people, mostly in first world countries. If this becomes solved in Defi in a decentralized way it can be scaled to all of humanity rather than the limited countries credit services exist in today. This is where a company like Visa will actively get involved eventually because it is a Trillion dollar opportunity that will let them expand their user base.

These systems won't take root in Defi until we have a good system for proving an address belongs to someone and that they singularly claim that address for these credit systems. Once we have that we'll see a variety of credit score DAOs appear in short order. They will essentially act like competing underwriters but unlike Tradfi the performance of each will be public and every app will be free to choose whose opinion they respect and pay for.

I'm also still curious about [alternative credit systems](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/monetizing-honesty).

[u/LeagueGreedy](https://reddit.com/u/LeagueGreedy):

[u/etheraider](https://reddit.com/u/etheraider) and the EVMavs have done it again! We're creating another project similar to EIPandas to celebrate the Shapella hardfork! There are 3240 owls from 20 powlyments minting on Arbitrum for 0.00324 ETH, or 0.0019 ETH for the allOWList [https://www.autominter.com/list/withdrowls](https://www.autominter.com/list/withdrowls) We plan to hold a virtual mint party using oncyber so we can show off the artwork gallery style. The mint button will even be embedded into the virtual room!

Proceeds will fund the next EVMaverick public goods project. I know there's someone out there with an idea here that deserves funding!

We had a lot of fun using the beta of AutoMinter's new AI Art Generator for this collection! I had so much fun making this project that I'm raffling away 5 of my EIPandas to those who can use their referral link to get 5 friends onto the list!

And of course, thank you so much to the ethfinance community. I gravitated here when I was new to crypto because of the high level discussion. I "earned" my Maverick asking questions here knowing I could always get an informative response. I probably would have lost all my money to shitcoins without this subreddit, but thanks to y'all I'm staking and having the time of my life making AI owls.

As [u/LeagueGreedy](https://reddit.com/u/LeagueGreedy) mentioned we are excited to celebrate Shapellowl with you!

To commemorate we've created "Withdrowls!" 

They are intended to be fun, punny, celebratory NFTs for the community, AND as a special treat MANY members of our communities (ethfinanciers, daily dooters & EVM's) will have their own personalized punny owl name in the metadata to be "their own withdrowl" as a special little sentiment to commemorate the momentous occasion. 

Bob-Rowlssi, swagtimusprowl, owlexiskef anyone??  :P [u/Bob-Rossi](https://reddit.com/u/Bob-Rossi), [u/alexiskef](https://reddit.com/u/alexiskef) , [u/swagtimusprime](https://reddit.com/u/swagtimusprime)

ALL funds (100% of mint & royalties) from the Withdrowls will go towards funding the NEXT public goods project after rocketschool anyone in our community wants to create! 

We thought this would be a great way to incentivize people that have an idea to start building and to get people excited and involved in creating public goods/doing something new AND get funded for it!

Check out the Allowl list for additional details! Mint will be .0019 for allowlist and .00324 for public and will be on arbitrum for low fees!

Looking forward to all the Shapellowl celebrations! Will definitely be a hoot ;)

<summary>u/Ethical-trade talks about Ultra Sound things</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12i920r/daily_general_discussion_april_11_2023/jft3t1h/)

Just stumbled upon [a comment](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/xqyt74/comment/iqdxblk/) I made a few months ago in here: 

*"Any day could end up being the day there's been the most eth in existence ever."*

Happened to be posted less than 10 days from the peak on October 8.

Ether's supply has been going down since October 8. 

Checking [ultrasound.money](https://ultrasound.money) has become part of my daily routine even though no new information is really to be expected, I just find it soothing to look at, to marvel at. The Ethereum community has really created something never seen before: a system with a security that's economically self sufficient. 

I truly regret that the mainstream understanding of inflation is "price of things goes up" instead of what it truly is: "value of fiat goes down". This simple switch in mental model would be incredibly useful for the masses to realize some of the biggest and inherent problems with the current system. 

And at the same time, it would be incredibly useful to understand what's so special with eth.

It's been 208 days since the merge and there's been a net burn of more than 82,000 eth. During a bear market (or well, an eternal crab, hail). Total supply is now 120,438,242 eth, and it's clear we'll end up below 120,000,000 sooner or later. 

Since the merge deflation has been accelerating. But what will this look like during a bull market? When usage, euphoria, and greed go parabolic? When the supply is inversely proportional to the mania? 

Witnessing the supply chart take a vertical dive will be absolutely glorious for sure.

We'll soon visit the abyss.

This it how the Euler exploiter saga ends.

When the exploit happened a month ago, I would not have expected that we'd reach this step, all the funds I deployed there I've written off. The Euler saga is a unique story, full of drama and in my case a happy end. 

Those who deployed via a smart contract (e.g. aztec users) need some more patience as those affected users can't claim directly.

Happy Shapella Day and stay safe out there, fellow Ethfinancers!

Woah, did someone just exploit a vulnerability in the ERC-20 standard itself???!!! I am seeing a cascade of the largest ERC-20s like USDT and LINK getting all funds sent to 0x36c9aFAkE324b‚Ä¶. On etherscan.

Meanwhile other ERC-20s like DAI and USDC have frozen transfers in response. I‚Äôm impressed with their reaction times to be honest.

What sort of impact could this have on other EVM based blockchains like BNB? It seems like it will be a scramble for ethical exploiters to take funds before actual hackers do.

Anyway, no doubt April is wasting no time in showing how chaotic things can get on the 1st!

<summary>u/0xdefiant introduces himself to the sub and shares his project idea!</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/127app5/daily_general_discussion_march_31_2023/jefgnli/)

gm r/ethfinance, I had the chance to talk with u/jtnichol yesterday, pretty outstanding guy. He told me to intro myself here and share an idea I have.

My name is Anthony Garrett‚Äî I‚Äôm a college student at Gonzaga and I started [Bankless Advisor](https://www.banklessadvisor.com/) in the Bankless DAO, a platform to connect financial advisors and clients, but we're in need of a pivot-- the idea I have is an app.My vision for a BA app is to create a web3 directory for users to send trade proposals to each other. Each account is a web3 wallet for users to trade and comment on other trades. Our market fit would start with the Bankless community and college students ([SPAWN](https://www.spawn.global/)).However, my long-term vision for the BA app: We allow users to import their data from other social media networks to their web3 wallet and build smart contracts that pool users data to connect ad buyers to users.

***I believe that this project has the potential to do good for the world, and the way we value our data, but I need a passionate dev team to bring this thing to life. So here I am looking for any advice, any groups that you think align with this vision, or anyone who is looking to help. (or if this idea sounds psychotic, I'm open to anything).***

I'm just a young self taught front end dev (that get's a lot of help from chat-gpt), but I have experience building trade proposal tech for financial advisors at [Defi Steward](https://www.defisteward.com/). Also, I have written further about this decentralized data model in the BA substack (not an advertisement, but here is a [link](https://open.substack.com/pub/banklessadvisor/p/internet-society-and-the-philosophy)).

If you have read this far and have ANY comments or suggestions as a start this journey I am all ears.

\- Thanks, AG

<summary>u/Ender985 has the latest from the NFT world</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/127app5/daily_general_discussion_march_31_2023/jedxqmn/)

Meanwhile, in the NFT-verse..

Found this interesting development: a real estate agency sold off 20% of a house being rented in Texas, [using NTFs as ownership shares](https://blockworks.co/news/real-estate-investors-buy-nft-home). 

The property was valued at $235k, NFTs represented $100 of ownership (minimum buy was 5 NFTs, would have been easier to just make $500 NFTs..). In total, $45,600 was raised by the sale to 38 investors, who will then get their fractional part of the rent.

Estimating $1500 rent per month (not in TX so I have no idea of what prices look like over there), that would mean each $100 NFT share accrues $0.65 per month, so a median of $7.8 to each of the 38 investors.

Given these small numbers, the company decided to run this experiment on Solana, citing gas fees in ETH as a deterrent, and [bridging difficulties in L2s like Polygon](https://twitter.com/HomebaseDAO/status/1608604222433492992). Let's hope for these investors that when rent is due, the Solana network is still up :)

People were discussing u/Set1Less's post from yesterday in r/CC about the Arbitrum DAO drama but we can't directly link to r/CC because the mods there ban you for it. Surprisingly nobody copied a transcript so it's probably gone a bit under the radar in this sub. So here I am, shamelessly transcribing u/Set1Less's post.

> So Arbitrum distributed tokens last week and as per their tokenomics, it seemed that the team and VC allocation is locked for a year.
> 
> Well, they just made a proposal to grant themselves another 750 Million ARB tokens, worth almost $1 Billion from the DAO. They claim its for an "Administrative Budget Wallet". In reality, it looks like a blatant cash grab. Its the first governance proposal and they aren't even trying to be subtle about siphoning funds out.
> 
> Administrative Budget Wallet proposal
> 
> Under the disguise of operational and administrative efficiency, they are seeking to transfer 750 million tokens from the DAO to their own pockets, from which they will make "special grants" and what nots.

> In crypto, these things almost entirely mean cashing out for real world riches. We have seen thousands of examples of teams cashing out treasury funds. In Arbitrum's case, since the team and VC token allocations are locked, they are creating this new channel of funding which they can splurge on while their actual allocations remain locked.

> Some groups have already raised alarm against this blatant cash grab.

> These 750M tokens were supposed to be part of the treasury but now seemingly lay under the centralized control of 3 individuals.

> I hate to say it, but these kind of shady activities actually make people like Gensler right - by using shady structures from Cayman Islands, under the disguise of "DAO", they are staging a standard insider dumping scam where the team dumps token without any transparency while pretending their original allocations are locked.
> 
> Update:
> Apparently it seems that even before this vote has passed, Arbitrum team has already moved 40m ARB tokens to a new wallet, and then started distributing them to child wallets, and it appears from the transactions that millions have been already sent to Binance .

<summary>u/Bob-Rossi shares their thoughts as an ARB delegate</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/129amhp/daily_general_discussion_april_2_2023/jeppfhd/)

I guess a smidge late considering the threads yesterday and today, but obviously I want to post on it since I'm an ARB delegate for a decent chunk of people here.

First, I want to speak to AIP-1 as it stands on it's own as I think it's important for those delegating to get a feel for what I stand for. So for a second, let's ignore the now known issue at hand and presume the Arbitrum Foundation had not moved tokens yet / or I had voted before this was know. Maybe a pointless excercise at this point, but I find it important.

I would have still voted "against" in this case, with request for the AIP to be broken into smaller pieces.

I agree strongly with the first set of a DAO's AIPs being about setting ground rules for the DAO moving forward, especially with one as large as this. Not having a formal process in place can lead to disaster (ominous!), so this is important. However, I'm against trying to lump in too much at once. The obvious one is the 750M ARB to the Foundation Admin Budget, however frankly things like squeezing in a very loosely defined "Special Grants" process aren't a great idea either. Those are things that need fleshed out in their own debates / AIPs. It feels like those are things the foundation would assume would be controversial, but hoped to squeeze through due to the need for the overall framework taking priority. This AIP should have been broken into about 3 or 4 separate things.

Now, with that said and as it stands now, I'm obviously still continuing with my 'Against' vote. The issue I had before has only been exacerbated by moving funds before the vote. In reading comments on this daily thread and it seems that the community is largely asking for an "Against" vote as well, so I have an obligation to honor that within my duties as a delegate. Although honestely it does feel moot at this point given recent events... Others have surely said it better, but the fundamental issue is we can't accept funds being moved without DAO approval or else what is the point of this process? It should be interesting to see what happens now that we have a scenario where funds have been moved without approval from the DAO. Something I doubt will be resolved cleanly, as even before this was found out I was seeing forum pushback on the amount. I question if it will ever pass even upon a presumed rework / revote.

A final note, those who are delegating to me I don't blame you if this has soured the process... this has been sort of a smack in the face to me as well.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12aa0sa/daily_general_discussion_april_3_2023/jes0qwu/)

[u/KuDeTa](https://reddit.com/u/KuDeTa):

There was a fascinating MEV "exploit" this morning to the tune of about $20mil dollars as a result in flaw in how mev-boost relays communicate with validators. There is some discussion below in the daily, and here is a good summary: <https://twitter.com/samczsun/status/1642848556590723075>


The relay fix to prevent this happening again is here ([https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost-relay/pull/330](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost-relay/pull/330)). This does has some significant side effects, the biggest of which is that ~10 sets of relay beacon nodes are now responsible for propagating all new blocks. Our ([u/austonst(https://reddit.com/u/austonst)) relay (https://aestus.live) was taken offline for builders as soon as we became aware of the threat and will update before we come online again. Never a dull day in ethereum.

It's been patched, just waiting for a release to be cut.

[https://twitter.com/metachris/status/1642862456556130306](https://twitter.com/metachris/status/1642862456556130306)

From reading this, the issue has been mitigated and was caused by a bad relay that was gamed. From my undestanding -

Before:

1. Relay sends validator the header (withholds block so not to get frontrun) for signature, but the block is invalid.
2. Validator signs header
3. Relay sends validator the block
4. Relay attempts to publish the block but cannot because it is invalid.
5. Validator selects the top half of each sandwich from inside the block and MEVs them by putting their own tx in a different proposed block
6. No race between the two blocks because the relay block is invalid.
7. Validator gets slashed for 1ETH afterwards, walks away with $20M.

After:

Step 4 and step 3 are reversed. And Relay does not send the block if it cannot publish it first.

Edit: fixed slashing comment, slashed later.

How do you think this would resonate to someone outside of our space?

The internet and information age fundamentally changed how humans interact. Before the internet, blogs were called newspapers, politics & entertainment came through cable TV, and social media was the local bar or a town hall.

Today, there is a quieter, second revolution of the information age taking place. Once again, we are reimagining how humans interact. Just as with the rise of the computers and the internet this new frontier is ripe with opportunity.

The ideas that have captured the minds of these participants may sound as unlikely to you as the internet systems we take for granted today would have in 1990. Eventually this revolution is likely to affect everything money can touch just as the internet did for information. These tools will democratize access to opportunities previously withheld from you and control over these systems will flow to a new generation of tech enthusiasts like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. Billionaires are already being born of this.

Keep reading and I will introduce you to the new digital scarcity and human coordination tools powering this revolution. I will carve out a landscape of opportunity for you to explore further and help keep you safe while doing so.

Money shapes the world. We are programming our values into our money. By doing so we are reshaping the world.

<summary>u/austonst covers the post-mortem on the MEV exploit</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12c90ok/daily_general_discussion_april_5_2023/jf0ppeq/)

A [post-mortem has been published](https://collective.flashbots.net/t/post-mortem-april-3rd-2023-mev-boost-relay-incident-and-related-timing-issue/1540) about the mev-boost-relay incident a few days ago. The [attack has been](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12aa0sa/daily_general_discussion_april_3_2023/jes0qwu/) covered [here before](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12aa0sa/daily_general_discussion_april_3_2023/jesz8la/). But the post-mortem has more details, particularly about the different forms the attack can take, and the mitigations applied.

In general relays are now addressing a whole category of attacks that had been previously overlooked, in which the proposer is able to get access to the transactions in a block to be proposed before they're supposed to. Generally this results in the proposer getting slashed but the MEV can more than make up for it. Attacks include:

* The original form of the attack, in which the proposer signs and submits an invalid block, which the relay accepts, returning the tx contents and giving the proposer a chance to modify bundles as they see fit. Patched (but with some potential side-effects).
* A follow-up to the first form. After the patch, the relay won't return the tx's directly, but a savvy attacker could try to peer a beacon client as close as possible to the relay's nodes, and watch for the block as it begins to propagate around the network. If they can very quickly grab it, modify bundles, create a new block, and use a fast block distribution network to propagate it faster than the original, they might be able to pull off a similar attack. Not entirely solved, still an open question about how to make sure relays will always win the race.
* A form of multi-block attack; /u/t0bii just about [figured this one out](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/12b9hj4/daily_general_discussion_april_4_2023/jewlml6/). If a validator has two slots in a row, then in slot 1 they deliberately call getPayload late, knowing that they're going to miss the slot. But the relay still reveals the tx's, and since slot 1 is going to be missed, the proposer can modify the bundles and instead include them in slot 2, stealing all the value. Patched, but it's not a perfect fix and may have some serious side effects.

I assume that now that the post-mortem is out, the people more involved in the fixes (Flashbots, ultra sound, EF) are fairly confident that the main attack vectors are decently well patched up. So hopefully things will start to settle down a bit: it's been a busy couple of days at Aestus.

Finally, I want to emphasize a few parts of the post-mortem:

> It is critical that Ethereum has an MEV marketplace that is democratic and efficient. Vulnerabilities like those detailed in this post undermine the integrity of the MEV marketplace and the experience of its users. We call on the security, research, and open source communities to join us in hardening mev-boost and future enshrined PBS designs.

and

> First, we‚Äôd like to note mev-boost and the mev-boost-relay both have bug bounty programs. A potentially expanded bug bounty program is being coordinated.
> 
> Second, we encourage searchers to think carefully about how much MEV their strategies expose, willingly or inadvertently, given the extremely adversarial nature of the MEV market and to take actions to mitigate potential attacks. In light of recent events, we ask searchers to reevaluate all risks in the marketplace: code risks, networking risks, reorg risks, smart contract risks, etc. and manage their risks appropriately.
> 
> Third, we call on the research and security community to carefully study vulnerabilities like these in the context of enshrined PBS, where variants may be applicable.
> 
> Finally, this is a call for your contributions, as a community, to ensure a healthy and robust PBS market today and into the future

Please volunteer if you are a validator or a beacon node operator

There have been some legitimate stakers whose keys have been compromised. CLWP has helped verify their legitimacy and came up with a solution to set withdrawal address and front run the hackers. We need your help. Hackers might be trying to set their own withdrawal address for the stolen validators and you can help prevent theft during the upcoming Shapella launch. By volunteering with CLWP, you can help in a coordinated broadcasting of withdrawal address changes, and ensure that the impacted stakers funds are not stolen. For details on becoming a CLWP volunteer, please watch this video - 

<https://youtu.be/k2Gc-jGxPbw>


It‚Äôs really not that complicated. It just takes a few minutes of your time and is needed right now, before the Shapella launch to help the impacted stakers! You can also get one on one assistance on their Discord if needed - <https://discord.gg/pwuPA6K4zg>

I imagine a lot of people here are interested in keeping up with staking on Ethereum but don't have a ton of time to invest.. I think we have a good system that will help you stay informed about staking in about one minute a day: We're creating one minute clips from our content and posting them as YouTube shorts and on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ethStaker). I'd suggest turning on notifications for the EthStaker Twitter and checking them out when it's convenient for you to click.

Right now the clips are covering the goerli Shapella fork, tomorrow they'll include the Lodestar call that's happening today, and around April 1 they'll begin preparing everyone for the mainnet Shapella upgrade maybe with a highlight of previous major upgrade calls. 

I sincerely believe these short-form clips will take EthStaker's education reach to the next level and I hope you find value in them.

Here's another one: [Barney Frank Was Right About Signature Bank](https://www.wsj.com/articles/signature-bank-new-york-community-bancorp-flagstar-bank-crypto-barney-frank-fdic-9b825e2e). Written by *the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal*

Free-market capitalism can't work if you are afraid of the government seizing your business in the middle of the night because a secret cabal of politicians didn't like your law abiding business. And it looks like Wall Street is slowly waking up to this unprecedented authoritarian shift by the Biden administration. 

Today it was a bank serving crypto. Tomorrow it is a bank which has labour unions as it's customer base, or a bank which provides services to medical companies that include abortion services, or a company which was not ESG friendly enough, or a company which spoke too loudly and too brashly about the President. Seize em in the middle of the night and fire the leadership board and auction off the assets. Hopefully civic society makes enough noise about this and it's not too late to close the Pandora's box that Biden's staff opened.

Ive posted a bit about exploiting Large Language Models (such as GPT) before, but Im back with more. Even if you have no interest in this, I believe its important to have an understanding of how the data you input in these kinds of systems can later be used against you.

Definitely start by reading <https://blog.forcesunseen.com/jailbreaking-llm-chatgpt-sandboxes-using-linguistic-hacks>. Then proceed to <https://doublespeak.chat/> to apply these concepts.

As of my last post, there were 9 challenges. Forces Unseen more recently released this reflective post <https://blog.forcesunseen.com/llm-sandboxing-early-lessons-learned> along with 8 new challenges available at <https://doublespeak.chat>. 

For a demonstration of how language-based exploitation may be combined with traditional computer exploitation, <https://blog.luitjes.it/posts/injectgpt-most-polite-exploit-ever/> is ridiculously hilarious.

<https://protectai.com/blog/hacking-ai-system-takeover-exploit-in-mlflow> reveals a local file inclusion(LFI) which can lead to complete takeover of systems running MLFlow. This has been patched.

Trail of Bits has long been a leader in infosec research and auditing. <https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/03/14/ai-security-safety-audit-assurance-heidy-khlaaf-odd/> 'We Need a New Way to Measure AI Security' is an interesting read.

<https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/03/22/codex-and-gpt4-cant-beat-humans-on-smart-contract-audits/> 'Codex (and GPT-4) can‚Äôt beat humans on smart contract audits' offers a much deeper dive into this subject.

And in case this has post not been related enough to Ethereum, by chance I just found this article <https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/02/27/reusable-properties-ethereum-contracts-echidna/> 'Reusable Properties for Ethereum Contracts'.

EDIT: Just noticed that doublespeak.chat limits the # of queries you can make before having to purchase more. If anyone defeats the Count of Monte Cristo, Id love a second hint haha

<summary>u/tutamtumikia looks back at all the projects they have invested in over the past few years</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/122blya/daily_general_discussion_march_26_2023/jdrr166/)

Well, I took a good hard look at everything I had put money into in this space over the past 3 years.  When I boiled it all down almost all of it seems to fall into the category of a project run by naive people, run by scammers, or artsy crap that I enjoy but should never have spent so much money on.

Some of defi protocols I tinkered with make me feel so stupid now. 

Here's one.  Tokemak. To this day I still don't quite understand it all.  I popped into their Discord and the team is spending over a half million dollars a month on basically nothing.  $35k+ in one month on "Marketing and Community".  At what point do you just outright call projects like this total grifts?

It's not that it's the only one either. It's a landscape of just gross misbehaviour, scams, and projects run by people who have NO IDEA what they are doing.

 I am SO glad that I only played around in the Defi and NFT ecosystem with total fun money, and left my real stack staked away.  I clearly had no business sticking my nose in any of that stuff.

There are a couple decent projects out there, but I feel pretty discouraged about the entire space today. Maybe having my eth unlocked soon is a good thing :(

<summary>u/pr0nh0li0 shares CoinCenter's coverage of the very alarming RESTRICT act</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/125dn51/daily_general_discussion_march_29_2023/je4xyl9/)

We've had a little bit of discussion here regarding the RESTRICT Act, which is the legislation drafted with the pretty explicit intent of banning TikTok if necessary. [Coincenter just put up a great post about how it's broad language is problematic](https://www.coincenter.org/the-restrict-act-creates-blanket-authority-with-few-checks-to-ban-just-about-anything-linked-to-a-foreign-adversary/). The rub:

> we are very concerned that an overbroad interpretation of those powers could be exploited in order to ban Americans from using entire classes of technologies, even when no foreign adversary has an actual proprietary interest in the technology as a whole

A big problem they highlight is that while there's already similar legislation that allows the government to block foreign transactions that are against the national interest (RESTRICT grants the powers to the Secretary of Commerce much like the IEEPA grants powers to OFAC), this law as far fewer oversite and review protections, which is particularly problematic for legislation that provides such broad authority:

> A broad and discretionary power to ban and disrupt all manner of information technologies should not be wielded without appropriate oversight and opportunity for review. The RESTRICT Act not only fails to ensure these rule of law protections, in many cases it attempts to subvert them.

This problem perhaps clearest when one observes that the IEEPA had amendments (the Berman Amendments) added that act as statutory protections for free speech, but RESTRICT has no such protections/limitations:

> Courts have found that the Berman Amendments, in effect, save the statute from potential unconstitutional applications. When plaintiffs challenge a sanctions designation that impacts speech, they can argue that OFAC exceeded its statutory power by contravening the Berman Amendments, rather than making the somewhat more difficult but also more consequential argument that IEEPA, the statute itself, contravenes the Constitution.

> In contrast, the RESTRICT Act has no such statutory limitation. Indeed it is deliberately targeted at restraining transactions related to information and information technologies.

A lot of other good stuff in there about how it could impact Crypto directly as well (e.g. that the Secretary could "argue that the entire class of all Bitcoin transactions, for example, is a class of transactions in which U.S. foreign adversaries have an interest" and should be banned), but all that is to say: call your representatives and tell them they should not support this bill.

<summary>u/austonst has the latest development in the MEV relay ecosystem</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/125dn51/daily_general_discussion_march_29_2023/je76vss/)

The Blockswap folks have released their [Proof of Neutrality relay](https://dapp.ponrelay.com/) on Goerli and provided [some documentation](https://docs.ponrelay.com/). I've been following their project for a while, the ideas are interesting. If it works, it's actually quite a large step forward in terms of PBS design. They claim relays cannot see the contents of blocks, there's a MEV smoothing pool built in, and (like the optimistic submissions being deployed by the [ultra sound relay](https://github.com/michaelneuder/optimistic-relay-documentation/blob/main/proposal.md) and elsewhere) relays don't have to perform validation before sending a block on. Builders instead post collateral to be used in case they try anything funny.

But while the ultra sound relay's system has the relay operator holding the collateral themselves, the PoN system is integrated into smart contracts with third party reporters acting as oracles to detect violations and penalize offending actors accordingly. All in all it's potentially (remains to be seen) an improvement over the current system

I don't find their documentation to be very complete (or even accurate?), and their recently-published [GitHub repos](https://github.com/pon-pbs) contains [a fork of mev-boost-relay](https://github.com/pon-pbs/pon-relay) without attribution to Flashbots or a proper commit history. And the actual meat of the system, centered around Restrictive Partially Blind Signatures, is [closed source](https://github.com/pon-pbs/pon-reporter) and undocumented so far. It's also concerning that their [proposer guide](https://docs.ponrelay.com/pon/pguide) has you input your keystore.json and enter your password (?!). They've confirmed to me that it's only used locally (not uploaded) to prove that you control the validators you're registering, but this is not the way to do it.

It's something to keep an eye on if you're following the cutting edge of MEV and block production stuff, or if you have goerli validators and want something to test. Otherwise maybe hold out for more info.

Side note: [MEV-Boost Community Call 2](https://collective.flashbots.net/t/mev-boost-community-call-2-30-mar-2023/1465) tomorrow at 16:00 UTC. Going to be plenty of boring technical stuff about shapella readiness and optimistic relay rollouts.

I urge anyone who hasn't done so to read through the chapter on digital assets in the Economic Report of the President. It's gives a full picture of the deviousness and flippancy of the Biden administration towards crypto. Take this gem on pg 238 for example

> crypto assets to date do not appear to offer any investments with any fundamental value, nor do they act as an effective alternative to fiat money, improve financial inclusion or make payments more efficient; instead their innovation has been mostly about creating artificial scarcity in order to support crypto assets' prices - and many of them have no fundamental value

Complete horseshit. They **do** act as a non-inflationary alternative to debasement of fiat money, today. They *do* act as a self-custodial alternative to money which relies on trusting banks which are literally teetering, today. 

They *do* improve financial inclusion. A kid in rural India or Mexico or Romania can take part in the Ethereum defi ecosystem with just an internet connection, today. Trading securities and treasuries and holding American dollars is a privilege to a tiny fraction of the world, and it's sad to see the Biden ainistration not see this. 

They *do* make payments more efficient. This is increasingly clear for internet native payments. Buying and selling digital native art and culture, paying members of a DAO, transferring funds to colleagues in the same team but all over the world, making small payments in countries like Nigeria and Lebanon with collapsing local currencies - various crypto solutions *do* make payments efficient in these instances, today.  

And last and most importantly of all, is that *even if crypto had no usecase* (which isn't true as I pointed out above), even if, that value judgement is still not the business of the federal government. Here's a great take by Chervinsky 

> [Too many policymakers are playing venture capitalist, guessing which technologies will be valuable and which won't.Tech neutrality is a core principle of good policy for a reason. Picking winners and losers is hard enough for the professionals. Government should stay out of it.](https://twitter.com/jchervinsky/status/1638365111508246531)

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11slqjw/daily_general_discussion_march_16_2023/jcggo1x/)

dang. First time I've ever fallen for something stupid. I went to check out Arbitrum eligibility and clicked the first link under the announcement. The link did look like a scam to me but I had just read a friend comment that the legit airdrop announcement / video "looks like a scam", so my brain had its defenses down. Only connected and *I think* it just took whatever already had approvals? Which was all my DAI. feelsbadman.jpg - 5400 DAI is no small sum. It unfortunately looks like they got a few people before the tweet was hidden.

My brain finally went 'nope' when it asked to approve RPL, but everything before that was just a signature to connect (I think?), not a transaction or approval. 

Things I could have done better (that I usually would do!):

- Matched the twitter handle from the tweet to the actual account    
- Found the link elsewhere (verified it) before connecting my wallet, especially in their discord    
- Generally slow down and read when signing things from my wallet.     

Expensive lesson learned! I'm going to lay down and watch a movie or something, I'm super bummed that I'm a dummy.


Another thing learned in this (thanks to /u/Ribilla_ ) - DAI is a special kind of ERC20 that allows transfers that require only a signature (`permit`, which is a signature-based approval function) - it doesn't look like your typical approval or transaction. So even signatures when connecting to sites should be treated as potentially dangerous and giving away your assets.

It's still a developing story ... if you missed episode 1 and 2, you find them here: [link](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11q1nrm/daily_general_discussion_march_13_2023/jc3gqo1/) / [link](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11slqjw/daily_general_discussion_march_16_2023/jceexxm/)

**S02E03 - The merciful hacker (cont.)**

After the exploiter sent 100 ETH to one affected user, DLNews identified this lucky person. DLnews is actually quite good - I didn't know Defillama has it's own newspaper! After [Swap.defillama.com/](https://Swap.defillama.com/) it's another killer product of the Llama universe ...

The interesting part of this episode is: The 100 ETH are actually worth more than what the user lost 78 wstETH (or 86 ETH). Essentially, the user would have profited from the "deal". Being now officially doxxed he sent back 12 ETH to the official Euler depositor address. Is this correct? Who knows, we'll see if Euler will push for the full amount to be returned. It's a subplot which runs through the entire season. ...

For more information on this incident, I refer directly to DLnews:

[https://www.dlnews.com/articles/regulation/euler-finance-hacker-eth-wallets-solidity-developer-exploit/](https://www.dlnews.com/articles/regulation/euler-finance-hacker-eth-wallets-solidity-developer-exploit/)

**S02E02 - The maniac hacker**

Every morning the hacker gets up, he's doing something with his freshly earnt money. If you own $200M you can have some fun with it, right?

So, Today morning, he decided to give 100 ETH to the allegedly North Korean and OFAC sanctioned Ronin Exploiter Address, probably Lazarus controlled. Here is the tx: [https://etherscan.io/tx/0x202a67d3a1d52e4dd5e1eebe49da511164b6e4a1ebe717dcf4674dd83a2bd457](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x202a67d3a1d52e4dd5e1eebe49da511164b6e4a1ebe717dcf4674dd83a2bd457)

Is he trying to fool us? Some kind of weird joke of 21 year old hacker? Or is it some kind of attribution to them? What will come next? Sending some to SBF or Alamada?

Or is he just bored and want his warrant level raised like in GTA?

Before he sent the 100 ETH to KimJongUn, he moved 1k ETH between his wallets but it's sitting there idle. At the moment, in total only 1.5k ETH has been sent to Tornando, the rest still in ETH (85k) or DAI (35 M).

**S02E03 - Tornado Cash Activity**

I did some tracking of the wallets which have used Tornado Cash recently. The activity has fallen quite a bit after it was hit with OFAC sanction rule. So it's kind of easy to track the activity even visually and manually. Here is the result:

[https://imgur.com/a/IbbO5db](https://imgur.com/a/IbbO5db)

I'm a bit surprised that 125ETH (and a batch of 100 ETH) went pretty straight from Tornado into Binance. The other larger chunks were moved into railgun and multiBTC, only some smaller amounts ran over "privacy oriented" exchanges.

It seems that the merciful-maniac hacker has not cashed their ETH out yet.

Okay Okay -- Heres the official Post-Mortem thread for the Euler hack: <https://twitter.com/TraversaJulian/status/1636782111616122881>

I reposted an earlier draft of it yesterday but I think the conversation here should really be around how safe people felt Euler was.

It was generally considered "as safe" as Compound, Aave, Maker, etc., and having a loss of ~$200m kind of breaks many previous assumptions about safety...

So my only conclusion is that we need to move towards more resilient mechanisms, mechanisms that cost significantly more to execute but are necessary to move forward effectively.

- Rate limiting
- Explicit / Limited Upgradability
- Built in diversification
- Circuitbreakers
- Isolated custodial modules

It really goes on, but these can only be effectively done if we all move towards L2's.

With the arb airdrop, now is the time to push for L2 adoption and the security that we really need to move DeFi forward.

<summary>u/Kukai_walker drafted a letter to their representative and shared the template for you. YES YOU</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11tipbq/daily_general_discussion_march_17_2023/jcm0fi7/)

At the encouragement of u/TheCryptosAndBloods [yesterday](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11slqjw/comment/jcfgbdu/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), I drafted a letter to my US representative, who happens to be among the 100+ member [Congressional Progressive Caucus](https://progressives.house.gov/home).  I took the perspective that crypto is well aligned with progressive principles so they should engage.  Including here for crowdsourcing feedback to improve it and/or for others to cut and paste from it especially if you too have a CPC representative:

=======================

Dear Representative xxx:
  
\[removed doxxable intro\]

I am writing to you today to **encourage you and CPC to engage actively in policymaking around digital assets (aka, crypto)**.

As one of the 20% of Americans who own digital assets, I have used much of my recent time to teach myself about digital assets and the broader domain of blockchain technology.  This is a highly technical field, requiring me to learn about such areas as cryptography, finance, decentralized networks, computing, and others.  This knowledge has yielded practical benefits in that I have learned how to join thousands of others to stake ether on the Ethereum blockchain which now provides me with a steady income.

This knowledge has also allowed me to cut through the hype, misinformation, and disinformation surrounding cryptocurrency in the popular discourse to conclude that in fact, **the crypto ecosystem of digital assets, smart contracts, and public blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum has value and will disrupt economic and business systems around the world.** For instance:

‚Ä¢ Decentralized financial protocols allow everyday people to instantly make payments around the world and make loans and other financial transactions without commercial middlemen

‚Ä¢ Immutable and transparent records on the public blockchain can protect intellectual property and assure fair and transparent management of royalties

‚Ä¢ Public blockchains can serve as a permanent store of critical personal events including birth, death, graduation, etc.

‚Ä¢ Assignment of unique non-fungible tokens can help manage ownership and transfer of collectibles, valuables, artwork, etc.

‚Ä¢ Blockchain has potential business uses such as on-line gaming, supply chain management or carbon credit system.

‚Ä¢ The crypto ecosystem can transform the internet business model from allowing dominant internet platforms (eg, Facebook, Google, Apple) to own and profit from personal information to a ‚Äúweb3‚Äù model where the user controls their own data on the blockchain.

I have also been struck by the fact that **there is significant alignment between the principles underlying cryptocurrency and the progressive agenda.**  The essence of the crypto ecosystem is that data and open-source computer code distributed and synchronized around the world can replace reliance on institutional middlemen (eg, banks, internet platforms) with a decentralized transparent system available to all whose trust comes from the decentralized crypto ecosystem in which users can directly take custody of their own assets and personal data.  These features can directly support the progressive agenda and its commitment to sweeping, transformative change:

‚Ä¢ Income inequality can be reduced by helping underserved populations‚Äîwho under legacy systems often cannot get a loan, buy a house, or start a business‚Äîto build wealth and carry out financial transactions without needed to rely on gatekeeping banks that may have institutional biases that disadvantage them.  

‚Ä¢ Facilitating crypto use can help advance racial justice and equity.  A 2019 FDIC survey found that 14% of African American households and 12% of Hispanic American households were unbanked compared to only 2.5% of white households.  A recent Harris Poll found that 30% of Black Americans and 27% of Hispanic Americans owned crypto compared to 17% of white Americans.

‚Ä¢ Replacing banks with self-custody and a fully transparent accounting on a public blockchain will reimagine the role of institutions that exacerbate injustice and inequality. 

**Congress must and will create a policy framework for digital assets in the US; it will be important to help shape this policy to promote progressive principles.** Now is the time to act.  Congress will likely see a number of bills introduced this session on such issues as rights to self-custody, defining digital asset taxonomy, and clarifying regulatory oversight.  Discussion on such legislation has already begun in the new Digital Assets, Financial Technology, and Inclusion Subcommittee of the House Financial Services Committee which has recently expanded its scope to include cryptocurrency.  This Subcommittee includes two CPC members‚Äîrepresentatives Torres of NY and Sherman of CA.  The CPC can utilize its subcommittee membership and other opportunities to actively engage in shaping this legislation to reflect progressive priorities.

Moreover, **engaging on this issue provides a great opportunity for bipartisanship.** The need for regulation has bipartisan agreement. A number of Republican members have been actively supportive of addressing policy in this area (eg, representative Emmer of MN, Davidson of OH, and others).  It would be remarkable, yet natural, to join forces with the other party on this issue to demonstrate its importance to the American people.

In addition to legislation, **progressive congressional oversight is needed**. I have been dismayed at the administration‚Äôs actions that, in the context of overall banking system failures and under the guise of consumer protection, are inhibiting the development of a regulatory environment that would allow the digital asset sector to prosper.  There are those who believe that the administration is responding to entrenched interests that are threatened by the transformative change that crypto may catalyze, taking advantage of the current banking crises to squash crypto, such as by discouraging banks from holding crypto or servicing crypto clients.

I hope you and the CPC will take on this important issue to both support the progressive agenda as well as keep America‚Äôs leadership in this new sector.  Blockchain and crypto are borderless by nature.  If the US cannot provide a fertile environment for innovation, the developers will go elsewhere and will not be serving the country or its people.

Thank you very much.

<summary>u/LogrisTheBard finishes his post on decentralised identity</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11ufzg6/daily_general_discussion_march_18_2023/jco0gh3/)

Revised/finished post from the other day.

DID (Decentralized ID) systems are a hot topic right now. They are needed for everything from free to play games, social media networks, and airdrops to governance systems like OPs Citizens House. There is (rightly so) a lot of buzz and various takes on how to approach this topic. I think this is one of the existential risks of Defi and I've written about that [before](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/defi-governance-endgame/) (that sure aged well). I'm personally in favor of the [Gitcoin Passport](https://go.gitcoin.co/passport) framework that enables each user to define their own calculation for Sybil Resistance by identifying their stamps and then having an attestation system like I proposed [awhile ago](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/harnessing-collector-psychology-for-good/) compress long form off-chain calculations into simple on-chain maps. The focus of these systems ends at being a proof of humanity per address. They are specifically attempting to solve Sybil-resistance.

However, I think there is the potential to layer reputation systems like credit scores on top of Sybil-resistance and I think the potential of this is largely unexplored. For the sake of this discussion I'll limit reputation to being a purely quantitative, monetary history of honesty rather than history of competence, impact, or ideology. In that context reputation is synonymous with trust. If we want to keep this purely quantitative, what can we objectively measure about something (e.g. code, people, institutions, etc) that makes people trust it? Here are what I think are the three primary pillars of trust:

* **Social Attestation**. When someone signs off on a code review, they are making an attestation. Systems like BrightId and Proof of Humanity are entirely social attestations. These systems are inherently subjective and usually *gameable* so are unreliable on their own but much of the world is entirely built upon attestation layers (your government ID for example).

* **Time**. The longer something has been there the more time attackers have had to inspect it, identify a vulnerability, and attack it. The longer a person has been around the more opportunities have arisen that might lure them to dishonesty. In a permissionless system, time proves doubts to be illusory in the same way that a $20 bill on a busy street is probably fake or glued to the floor the longer it sits there.

* **Opportunity Cost of Honesty**. Watch carefully how trust is used once granted. Any position of trust is exploitable to some degree. Otherwise what are you trusting? Honesty is the degree to which an actor is *suboptimal at exploiting that trust*. Yes, I'm aware how unintuitive that definition of honesty sounds but that's as close as I've come to a formal definition. Your unexploited trust value (UTV) is your maximum exploitable trust - exploited trust.

These pillars stand together to form the base on which a credit system could be built. They are a subset of what Vitalik [identified](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html) in his post on legitimacy.

The first two are straightforward to measure. The latter is a bit more like measuring carbon deltas for Carbon Credits, Sybil values, or MEV because the maximum exploitable trust term is so subjective. With PoS Sybil-resistance is derived from the money you have. Conversely, your UTV is derived from the money you don't (in a sense). It's the money you *don't* have because you chose to be honest. This is akin to the forgery-resistance score from Gitcoin passport being floored at the amount you have spent/lost.

The fact that this is subjective (and potentially monetizable) will probably lead to competing standards for how to calculate it much like credit agencies today. Your address will have the equivalent of an Experian score from multiple aggregators which combines the three pillars above into a single number that anyone can query. Each Defi protocol could choose to use a different score, a combination of scores, or create their own score. Could this lead to abuse by an agency? Yes, but less than the current system which isn't permissionless. 

But how do you bootstrap trust if no one will give you a position of trust you can honor/exploit? You can't bootstrap a system like this based on unsecured loans without first getting robbed by a few ten-thousand *Sybilooors*. The capital efficient answer today is to get involved in communities until someone is willing to grant you trust based on social attestation and time alone. That lacks a certain scalability element though. I think we can do better, even while remaining permissionless. You have to rely on some form of *suboptimality* otherwise the system will be gamed for profit. So what forms of permissionless economic suboptimality are already on-chain? The few that come to mind for me are donations to public goods, unrealized losses on airdrops, suboptimal votes in the face of bribes, and delegated credit.

None of these are perfect. The first criteria requires money to bootstrap. The second and third may have ulterior selfish motives the system can't see. The fourth is basically an extension of social attestation and just begs the question. So how do you bootstrap trust on someone with nothing to give and nothing to lose? I have no good answer but the above is the beginning of a formulation.

Why does it matter? Because this value can be integrated into tokenomic systems. I mentioned unsecured lending above, which is probably the first thing that comes to mind when you hear credit system, but I think that's actually one of the worst use cases for this. To explain why, we first have to break Defi collateral into two categories. The first category is money used as collateral for good behavior but which doesn't have a credibly neutral recipient. ETH staking is the largest example of this category but there are many others. The only criteria here is that the system has an objective, enforceable slashing condition. In this category the money just needs to be forfeit by the staker but it doesn't need to **go anywhere**. The second category is money used to reimburse someone. This includes all your money markets, collateralized stablecoins, insurance protocols, etc. It is more viable to use UTV as collateral for the former category. I wouldn't recommend this for the Ethereum base chain because the data to calculate this is on the base chain and this is a subjective score, not credibly neutral.

So where does this get us? Take a PoS system (not DPoS, that's dumb). The purpose of this system is to reach consensus on something. There are two necessary economic components to a PoS system. First, you have to be able to reward honest actors to incentivize participation. Second, each actor needs something at stake they can lose by being dishonest so you have entropy of bad actors over time. I've never seen a system designed so the failure of the dishonest actors is the main reward driver of the honest ones so I assume any such system has a revenue stream attached to it. Now, could we use reputation credit/UTV for such a system in lieu of capital? It certainly satisfies the something at stake requirement. You just have to be able to prevent collusion in the system and prevent bad actors from joining at a faster rate than the dishonesty entropy.

To prevent collusion I'll rely what I call Bitcoin's/Satoshi's great insight. The failure rate of attacking a network scales super-linearly with the number of anonymous actors in that network. This is because the chance of leaking a secret scales exponentially with the network and there is a common Schelling point to unify against dishonest actors once a secret is exposed. This is the *primary* value of decentralization. Past a certain threshold it is safe and profitable to be honest and risky and expensive to be dishonest. So the key to preventing collusion is to increase decentralization and protect anonymity of actors. Defi satisfies this.

To solve dishonesty entropy we're just using a different collateral (which is still a scarce resource). Today we use capital for Sybil-resistance. This does not provably satisfy the entropy condition and so plutocratic attacks on PoS systems today are *possible*. Given the source of this alternative collateral (historical honesty) UTV may prove out to be a superior selection criteria for identifying honest consensus participants.

This actually creates a beautiful sort of flywheel. By acting honestly you build a reputation score. You can stake your reputation in order to promise certain services. By fulfilling your promise you generate both an income stream and further reputation. This creates a compounding benefit to continue acting honestly. A world in which honest actors can build an income stream predicated on their reputation and potentially bootstrapped through community service is also a basis for UBI. It's a step closer to the type of world in which I'd like to live. A few disclaimers though. First, nothing is ever fully proven to be trustworthy. Second, trust is not monotonically increasing. As systems or the world with which they integrate change trust in them fluctuates.

P.S. I've been asked to plug an on-topic game from the EVMaverick's called Layer Zero. The basic premise of the game is to willingly enter into a contract with a group of people who can all openly rug the contract. Everyone has to put a share of collateral into the pot to join. Anyone in the game can take the pot. If no one takes the pot then everyone is generating UTV at the pot size * participants. Conceptually, a set of non-conspiring participants in a game like this can generate more in UTV than the money at stake. While UTV as defined above is scarce if it can be generated faster than capital it could out-compete capital for shares of revenue streams because of this.

<summary>u/0xBOBA hasn't been checking price for the last 3 months and checks in with us</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11vd15b/daily_general_discussion_march_19_2023/jcv3xmn/)

I tried to not check prices.  I lasted 3 months.  I ended up checking because of the SVB news.  Good to see ETH up 50% since I left.  Makes me a little less worried about my CDP.  The $ARB airdrop was a nice surprise too.  Glad I didn‚Äôt miss it while I was gone.  The only other thing I was really worried about while I was gone were my non-ETH holdings. 

With withdrawals coming I finally gave up on my LINK and swapped them for RPL.  More confidence in RPL than LINK.  Should have done it long ago. I got too attached to my LINK and waited too long for the ratio to recover.  (I‚Äôm a horrible trader). Lesson learned there.  But I need an exit plan for RPL. It‚Äôs only 2% of my portfolio though.  

I‚Äôve used this drop in the ratio to unload most of my BTC.  Now only 3% of my portfolio. 0% at 0.055 if my limit orders go through. A part of me wants to keep a little bit of BTC just for nostalgic reasons but I really don‚Äôt see the point of BTC. I skimmed some of the recent dailies and see others offloading their BTC.  This probably means the ratio will continue to drop ‚òπÔ∏è

So now I am 95% ETH and too heavy in ETHE in my retirement funds. Feels nice (other than the horrible ETHE price: what‚Äôs going on there?).  It was kind of nice not checking the price for a few months, but I also missed reading the daily. 

I‚Äôll probably stick around to claim my $ARB and maybe until withdrawals are enabled.  Anything fun to do on Arbitrum these days?   Something that won‚Äôt make taxes a mess next year.

They all sold out in a single block.

The project dominated ordinals secondary markets, with over $1M in volume, ahead of YugaLab's twelvefold ordinals by >7x. It seems ordinals are here to stay, and more so if they are backed by already established brands such as DeGods.

Yesterday some twitter user found out ~2400 compromised accounts all approving ARB. Someone analysed these (actually 2225) wallets and 1791 wallets are elligble for around 3 million ARB total.

<https://github.com/ArbitrumFoundation/sybil-detection/issues/3>

Many users became victim by following links under the announcement tweet. Suprised Arbitrum didn't provide the link to their website with the annoucement or turn off replies. They are not new to how crypto scams and hacks work.

<https://twitter.com/arbitrum/status/1636352104913666050>

Frustrating to see that so much damage is done. Users have personal responsibility sure. But I think the damage wouldn't be this big if Arbitrum guided users to the right place. Maybe I am a bit unreasonable here... 

Stuff like this can't be happening if crypto ever wants to become 'mainstream'.

<summary>u/busterrulezzz has something to say about Balaji</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11y8xk3/daily_general_discussion_march_22_2023/jd7n6bh/)

I will take Balaji seriously when he goes to explain his theory to people who have the intellectual background to ask him the hard questions.

His appearance on Bankless and the Pomp show yesterday were appalling. Those weren't interviews, they were oral presentations. He could have said that Satoshi was going to come down from heaven to wash away our sins and give us eternal life, and the hosts would have nodded their heads and said "woah."

Balaji is not the intellectual he claims to be. An intellectual does not choose hosts sold out to his cause to make his point - instead, he will go directly to confront those who disagree. This is the very basis of the scientific method. I also find his tone to be alarmist, dramatic, filled with hyperbole created to capture attention.

Who is he, anyway? He is an engineer who became a multi-millionaire in the early 2010s - he has no expertise in finance, history or politics, beyond what he has read elsewhere. Ironically, he made his fortune from the system he says he wants to escape today. His claim to fame is that he "predicted" the pandemic on January 30, 2020. Except that on January 30th, the WHO declared a "global health emergency", Wuhan had already been cut off from the rest of the world, there were confirmed cases in dozens of countries... He was a bit early, sure, but it is not the feat he claims.

Finally, about his $1M prediction, he has already prepared his exit. In three months he will say, "Oh, the bet was just a wake-up call, you shouldn't have taken it at face value, I'm not sure about the timeline, but hyperinflation will happen soon." It won't happen, and he'll push the deadline again and again, until he disappear into irrelevance.

Honestly... best that Coinbase, who's well-capitalized and equipped to handle this, to be the one to go to court with the SEC and set a precedent. A win for crypto against the SEC in court would be a big deal and there's no one better poised to do that than CB.

Lol holy crap bunch of dummies over there at NYAG office. At least Gensler's team understand crypto...

From: [https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=XDXIUrIw3tVafxqwEqVfKw==](https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=XDXIUrIw3tVafxqwEqVfKw==)

> Under proof-of-work, computers on the Ethereum network competed to answer amathematical puzzle in order to verify transactions on the blockchain and receive in-kind digital asset rewards. Under proof-of-stake, however, validators, pledge or ‚Äústake‚Äù their holdings in ETH and are randomly chosen to verify transactions on the blockchain and receive an in-kind digital asset reward. By shifting to proof-of-stake, ETH no longer relies upon competition between computers, but instead now relies on a pooling method that incentivizes users to own and stake ETH. The shift to proof-of-stake significantly impacted the core functionality and incentives for owning ETH, because ETH holders now can profit merely by participating in staking.

Lol, "*merely* by participating in staking" holy christ project much? Is this a highschoolers essay?

And why is it a security Ms AG?

> the Ethereum Foundation claims on its website that users of Ethereum ‚Äúsee it as a digital store of value because the creation of new ETH slows down over time.‚Äù

Lol just like bitcoin, which even Gensler has clearly stated is the only crypto he views as definitely NOT security? Can't even line up your arguments between agencies...

But wait there's more?

> Since transitioning to the proof-of-stake consensus, the value proposition has altered significantly because possession of ETH translates directly to profit potential by earning staking rewards

Hey everyone, did you realize that you're earning staking rewards just by holding Eth in your hardware wallet!!!!!

I have no idea how any of this will play out, but I can definitely say that NYAG is a fucking clown show compared the SEC when it comes to this stuff.

97.3% of SVB deposits are not FDIC insured. This means, most of \~$200 bln, that used to belong to many, many tech companies and start-ups, just disappeared. Probably many jobs will fallow.

[u/KotMyNetchup](https://reddit.com/u/KotMyNetchup):

According to their latest tweet, Circle stands to lose 8% of the USDC backing at most. It sounds like the most reasonable expectation is that FDIC will be able to recover a decent amount of funds from SVB. I'm expecting >50% to be returned. But looking at the pessimistic side, we have a 4-8% haircut on USDC. $0.92-$0.96. We're seeing that price range now.

The next question is if prices close enough to that range can be sustained long enough for Circle to be able to inject liquidity into the market as needed. I don't know what mechanisms Circle uses to do this, other than promises and market forces. If it comes down to promises and market forces that might not be enough.

Another question is at what point USDC price starts to have knock on effects beyond a simple bank run. A lot of defi is built around USDC. What systems will start to deteriorate if USDC starts to depeg more? At what point do systems start to fall apart?

<summary>u/nixorokish shares The Summer of Protocols</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11ngir4/daily_general_discussion_march_10_2023/jbn88dx/)

The first town hall for the [Summer of Protocols](https://mobile.twitter.com/TimBeiko/status/1632847129545940992) happens tomorrow, about 9 hours from this comment. 

If you're interested in participating, highly recommend attending! I haven't finished reading the Unreasonable Sufficiency of Protocols (sort of a manifesto for the course) yet but it's really good so far, very thought-provoking, and I'm thinking of recording a version to listen to.

*edit*. quick synopsis of the Summer of Protocols if you're lazy: it's basically a brain incubator where some very thoughtful people are going to get together and try to define what a "protocol" is, examine existing examples, and how to design one that is future-proof, capable of ossifying to some degree, incentivizes good outcomes, and look at how much stewardship that thing will need. 

This is awesome and, in my mind, the kind of philosophical analysis that we need to make sure Ethereum (or any protocol) has a sufficient amount of thought put into it to try to steer away from some of the dystopian outcomes that something like the internet has brought about.

If algorithms on the internet can change people's behaviors to rapidly foster a kind of hatred that causes people to do things they otherwise wouldn't have, why wouldn't we assume that that behavior-changing power also works in the other direction to incentivize willing participants to better coordinate with each other? This is why I'm here. Because the infancy of Ethereum is the most exciting and malleable part and I think something like this is capable of stewarding it to a place where it actually makes a difference.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11ocbsl/daily_general_discussion_march_11_2023/jbtp31j/)

> Literally how can people outside the "cryptosphere" look at crypto and not think "scam"?

A quote from u/geliboy695000 earlier today and I want to repost it here for exposure and discussion because it's important. 

When you look at social media, any time the topic comes up or problems in crypto are brought up, the threads are flooded with bots and scammers shilling whatever shitcoin they get paid to shill. If I were not already in the space and knew what goes on I'd 100% think cryptocurrency is just scams all the way down. And just to be explicitely clear: Ethereum itself has enabled this too with ERC-20s and the like. [Just look at what's literal number 4 in market cap among those tokens](https://etherscan.io/tokens) and then scroll down further for all the less popular bs coins like Dogelon & co. 

We need to somehow find a way to exclude the grifters and scammers from the discussions while still being open and true to the crypto ideals, and also welcoming to newcomers and open to new ideas. It seems like mission impossible.

How can legitimate projects be promoted without at the same time giving exposure to the wrong people? How can the general public be educated, because it doesn't seem  knowledge of blockchain tech and its uses has increased that much in the mainstream over the past years. The majority of people still doesn't even seem to understand even just Bitcoin, which has been around for 13 years now and is arguably the most basic and among the easiest blockchains to understand in principle. 

This matters, because if most people do not understand how this tech can help society and how it works, they'll think it's useless and will support legislation that cracks down and hinders crypto adoption. They might cheer the criminalization of private non-KYCed wallets only to find a couple of years down the line to be forced to use CBDC and have banks not only control their money but monitor all their habits as well. It's probably not what the majority wants but if we don't help them understand they won't know anything about it.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11q1nrm/daily_general_discussion_march_13_2023/jc3nqn3/)

Dear EVMs, EIPanda‚Äôs and the ETHFinance community,

I come before you today to genuinely ask for your help. Please take the time to read this, I know it is long but I believe it is important. No jokes this time. Thanks in advance friends.

As you may or may not know, I started a website called ‚ÄúCaches.‚Äù If you‚Äôve never visited it, I will briefly explain. If you have, then you already know. Caches is a social network/community website focused on Web3 Technology and Ethereum. A place to explore all of the interesting technologies and ideas that are spinning off of this new paradigm that we all love. It‚Äôs completely anonymous, and membership is free and only available via Ethereum wallet login.

I intended for Caches to be somewhere for our community to teach, and share our knowledge outside of the walls of third parties like Reddit or Discord. Something we own, so our voices can be properly heard, and so they can‚Äôt be muted due to some draconian corporate attack on crypto or something. A place where you could ‚Äúcache‚Äù your content and share it with the world anonymously, using identity technology being pioneered by Ethereum. Our mark on the world outside our biosphere. I also hoped we could show the world how you build a community, powered by web3 technology, out here on the old www... A home.

Now I have a lot of ideas, but that‚Äôs the gist of it. I have spent a lot of time in this pursuit and I have struggled with it. The platform I chose to build Caches on, WordPress, has absolutely no help, plugins, or extensions for crypto/web3. Really no good CMS platform out there does. Since I am a terrible coder, and I am already familiar with developing websites rapidly using Wordpress, I chose to move forward using it to save time, for better or for worse. This has been an adventure to say the least.

Recently, I spoke with another EVM, [/u/juxtanotherposition](https://reddit.com/u/juxtanotherposition), and we immediately hit it off. Turns out, just by stroke of luck that on March 24th, 2023 he will be giving a presentation at WordCamp Phoenix on *‚ÄúWordpress, Community and Web3.‚Äù* Strange how the world works sometimes ‚Ä¶ Caches is built on Wordpress, it has custom developed Web3 authentication and NFT gating, and it was made for a community‚Ä¶ his very own community! This was literally a match made in heaven! So with all that said, we agreed to feature Caches during the presentation as an example of community built on Wordpress with web3 tech!

That means **we will have eyes from the Wordpress developer community focused on Caches and the EVM!** *AAAAHHHH!* This is why I need your help! Now look, I know I‚Äôm funny, and I make you laugh, and maybe you‚Äôve even checked out Caches once or twice to humor me, and then laughed yourself to sleep ... but I need them to see the value in this. Not just for me, or Caches, or the EVMs ‚Ä¶ for Ethereum.

**Why is Wordpress important?**

Wordpress is a free, open source content management system that powers an astounding **43% of all websites** online. I bet you didn‚Äôt know Caches ran on Wordpress before I told you, did you? A lot of your favorite sites run on it. It‚Äôs free, open source, community developed, and extensible. It also runs on a completely opensource technology stack. Wordpress.org develops the Wordpress software and they are a non-profit entity. Their ethos is very aligned with ours. They want to enable people to have their own platform to share their ideas, and words without having to rely on anyone. You can check out their [about us](https://wordpress.org/about/) page if you aren‚Äôt familiar with them.

**Why is this important for the community?**

Since Caches was built for the EVM/ETHFi community, we have a very unique opportunity to get our ideas, and our community out to potentially thousands of Wordpress developers who will be viewing Caches during @juxta‚Äôs presentation. They will undoubtedly share Caches with other developers. That means we have an opportunity to get web3 ideas and even our community baked into Wordpress! I literally can not think of a bigger opportunity for us, and for Ethereum. If we can get developers to create plugins, extensions, themes and more that enable and integrate web3 technology into Wordpress, we have an opportunity to put this in front of 43% of website owners WORLDWIDE! I can not think of a better group than all of you to guide and usher these people into this new paradigm.

With our help we can get this technology out to the world, and we can foster the Wordpress community during their exploration of this new technology. Give them a place to safely ask questions and get good answers ranging from JBM to Logris level. A place to share ideas, develop friendships and connections ‚Ä¶ just like we all have done through the sub. This is our opportunity to put the community at the forefront of something big outside our walls and build ourselves as an authority in this space.

**What‚Äôs in it for me?**

Juxta has asked if Caches could be a sort of ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù test bed for Wordpress web3 plugins and technology. I like this idea, we get free development work to make Caches the premier web3 community and the developers get a real live site to develop their product. This is a win/win/win! I get to see the thing I started grow and flourish at the hands of people much smarter and more capable than me. It‚Äôs beautiful man! That‚Äôs really it. I hope to use it to make money, however we decide to do that, just like you.

**What‚Äôs in it for you?**

I honestly built this site for our community. I genuinely built it to enable everyone to be heard out here on the web. As I have repeatedly stated, I don‚Äôt want to own this thing by myself. So I hope you can join me, we can come up with new ways to push Ethereum/web3 forward in the web2 and we can come up with creative ways for everyone in the community to earn some money for themselves without turning into a marketing machine. I want everyone to be a part of that journey, and I want everyone to be able to contribute ideas to that goal, and most importantly I want to work with you to figure out how we can own this thing together in the fairest way possible. I don‚Äôt have any of that figured out, but that‚Äôs ultimately where I want to be‚Ä¶ a community owned and operated by the community.

**How can I help?**

Pop in the EVM discord. If you're not an EVM, I still want your help. Please. Join the public-channel and DM a mod to have the "Caches" role added to your account and then you'll be able to see the #caches channel there even if you don't have an EVM. I will use that to try to collaborate and focus our energies best I can. I need you! We have just 10 days to try and make Caches, the community and Ethereum look good... but hey... this is just the beginning. So don't do it for me. Do it for **ETHEREUM.**

Sincerely,  
JBM üëäüèª

Ethtrader donuts were key in the formation of this sub. Not just because it triggered the exodus, but because of the type of people it promoted to leave. 

The people that hate grifts and cash grabs, the people that see this as more than a way to make money, the people that are in it for the tech, etc.

It distilled the community down to those that believe in the original ethos ethereum was founded on, and we do our best to carry forward.

Introduce a new table view! Where the NFT jpg is reduced to a few pixels, just like in Blur. The way art was always meant to be traded!

On a more serious note, this war has already caused some collateral damage, with the royalties race to the bottom. The argument goes that 10k profile picture collections probably should not have royalties, while it makes more sense for 1/1 art pieces. 

Well, the royalties paid on ArtBlocks (an NFT platform for curated artists) has now gone from 7.5% to 2.5%. This suggests that the markets for these two types of NFTs may not be so different after all.

<summary>Community: u/benido2030 ponders on building on a greater purpose for this community</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí]()

Yesterday two things that longterm members posts and that are not connected somehow caught my attention and made me think. The first one was [this post](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11evx0c/comment/jahzvw8/) by Bob Rossi, the second one was [a comment](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11evx0c/comment/jah4v8c/) by superphiz in a completely different thread. 

Some personal thoughts with regards to Bobs post: I totally feel you. I want to contribute more in the space and think I would be able to add some value here and there, but hell I am just a random anon on the internet that's mid bell curve. 

But what if superphiz is right (and I think he is)? What if EVMs (which I am going to replace with members of this sub, since not everyone does hold one) will become community guardians? What if this place is something special and if you have established yourself as a valuable and know community member you are highly likely to add value to projects in the ETH ecosystem, hence also hop? What if we used the community we have built here to send people to different DAOs to positively influence decisions made in the ecosystem? What if at one point any EVM and their arguments in a (DAO) discussion are seen with different eyes just because of the NFT?

<summary>Ecosystem: u/wolfparking covers ERC-4337</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11gsztq/daily_general_discussion_march_3_2023/jatsizb/)

This was deployed at the EthDenver conference: [ERC-4337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337). Am I right to think that this is a really underrated implementation?

I've read from a few sources that this level of account abstraction will eventually allow wallets to operate as programmable smart contracts; which could be used to recover lost private keys. We're not there yet, but still exciting!

News articles: [msn.com](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/other/ethereum-activates-account-abstraction-touted-by-co-founder-buterin-as-key-advance/ar-AA186sIg) and
[BusinessInsider](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/ethereum-activates-account-abstraction-touted-by-founder-buterin-as-key-advance-1032137536)

> Could allow users to do away with the common practice of backing up a set of words on a piece of paper, enabling new ways to secure wallets. For example, users could set up two-factor authentication to access a wallet via biometric data, or program multi-signature wallets providing shared access to a single account.

Additionally, this:

> Vitalik Buterin has stated that ERC-4337 enables a fully decentralized fee market for smart contract wallet operations.

Vitalik [posted](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1576199517434949634): 

> You should be able to send an op into a public mempool, and if it pays enough fees, reliably expect it to get included. This should NOT depend on ANY:
> 
> * Centralized actors
> * Reputation systems for op senders
> * ETH held in a separate EOA
> * External services for account creation

With L2 fee structure the fee requirement diminishes. 

I'm not technically skilled/knowledgeable enough to understand why this integration won't presently allow account recovery, but we're almost there apparently. Vitalik mentions that it can't be solved by ERC-4337, but EIP-3074 and EIP-5003 would get us there. Very cool shit. Anyone want to chime in on anything I misunderstood?

<summary>Ecosystem: u/hanniabu discusses Privacy Pools, the successor to Tornado Cash in response to the OFAC regulation</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11ip8sx/daily_general_discussion_march_5_2023/jb12o1q/)

Really surprised to see the Tornado Cash successor Privacy Pools isn't being discussed in more detail here

[https://twitter.com/ameensol/status/1632083054272430080](https://twitter.com/ameensol/status/1632083054272430080)

Since anybody can exclude any deposit, it seems it would be difficult to get any type of assurance of your anonymity set.

I also wonder if you can run into a situation where you can't withdraw. For example if a hacker makes a large deposit and then withdraws for others, then there won't be enough funds for everyone else to withdraw if they all want to exclude the hacker.

And not sure why the subsets are even needed if receipts are provided, which Tornado Cash already did.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11ip8sx/daily_general_discussion_march_5_2023/jb1i37k/)

BUIDL Week is over here at EthDenver. You may have noticed a lack of a certain [u/logristhebard](https://reddit.com/u/logristhebard) around the subreddit. That's because he has been diligently working on the [Logris Vaults](https://app.buidlbox.io/projects/logrisvaults). Some of you saw the Alpha that I dropped earlier in the week... we are now one step closer to the [Double Logris](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-double-logris/) becoming a reality. 

It's been a long week and Logris has been working flat out to get the project across the finish line. We're about to pitch in a little bit here... still waiting on our time so I can't tell you that. But, I'm really excited about what we accomplished and really Really REALLLLLYYYY proud of him. 

Logris says he's proud of [this function](https://github.com/DavionKalhen/LogrisV1/blob/78b5cc87fe29c7222b38da6624cf9e12503d54af/src/leveragers/EulerCurveMetaLeverager.sol#L158). What a nerd.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11jq6y5/daily_general_discussion_march_6_2023/jb48g07/)

**ETHDenver Day 10** ([Yesterday](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11ip8sx/daily_general_discussion_march_5_2023/jazo2by/))

The final day of ETHDenver! There were no traditional talks from established companies or researchers; today was all about the hackathon teams. Each project was submitted to one of five tracks (DeFi, Impact / Social Goods, DAOs / Community, NFT/Gaming/Metaverse, and Infrastructure) and could also compete for sponsor bounties ([big list here](https://app.buidlbox.io/ethdenver/ethdenver-2023)).

Projects had to be submitted by 8 AM, then from 10-2 teams showed off what they made. On the regular presentation stages, teams went up to the stage corresponding to their track and gave a 1:30 pitch and demo, with a little time for questions. When they weren't on stage, they were downstairs in the main buidl room where the sponsor bounty judges and random attendees could learn about what they made. Track judges picked the top three of each track to present on the main stage during the closing ceremony at 3 PM, then five final winners were chosen.

Miscellaneous notes: I don't think I can see an overall list of hackathon projects, but each one does have their own page if you know what URL to go to. But for most I don't know the URL so it's going to be hard to link to them. I also heard that there was a major hiccup where in the midst of planning out judging, a bunch of teams just got missed entirely and weren't scheduled for a pitch slot or a table location. The team worked to resolve it, but with everything happening so fast some teams were just screwed over. Hopefully it's better next year. Also I finally checked out the arcade area, good collection of imported Japanese arcade games, nice selection of rhythm games in particular.

* [**Logris Vaults:**](https://app.buidlbox.io/projects/logrisvaults) A good place to start off the list. DoubtStars has been [talking about this project](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11ip8sx/daily_general_discussion_march_5_2023/jb1i37k/) so I don't really need to. I didn't find the team on the buidl floor, but I can throw it on here anyway because it's cool.
* **ChainRep:** A project to put security audits and reports (or at least links and a general rating) on-chain. Reviews point to the smart contract in question, and are written by reviewers who are issued certificates by trusted entities like the EF or something. So you could potentially make a DeFi protocol that generally works with any ERC20 token, but checks ChainRep and only allows tokens with positive reviews from certified reviewers.
* **MintUI:** A library of React components for web3 that share information between one another to make web3 programming easier. Main example (as the name would imply) is NFT minting.
* **Composooor:** Would appreciate more insight into this. The team was saying something about how it's hard to build composable dapps/protocols using other protocols that rely on off-chain data. So this is a MetaMask snap (bounty hunting ho!) that simplifies this composability and significantly reduces the amount of code you need to create a clean integration.
* **Dual Rollup:** Cartesi is an [existing platform](https://docs.cartesi.io/cartesi-rollups/overview/) I'm only just learning about for developing optimistic rollups whose execution environment is literally a [Linux VM on RISC-V](https://docs.cartesi.io/machine/intro/). This project uses that to run a ZK *prover* on Cartesi, or ultimately a ZK rollup on an optimistic rollup. I get the concept but I feel like I'm barely able to grasp the implications. The team suggested you may be able to implement a universal (or at least cross-EVM) ZK bridge.
* **Alice's Ring:** A project for proof of solvency. With it, tenant Alice can prove to landlord Bob that she has enough assets to cover rent, notably *without revealing the actual address to Bob*. Then, if Alice later uses [zkBob](https://www.zkbob.com/) to actually pay her rent, Bob may never actually have to see Alice's actual assets. The team says that the proof must be computed over multiple blocks or something in order to prevent someone from proving solvency after taking a flash loan. But nothing is stopping Alice from generating the proof then immediately selling, transferring, or gambling it away.
* **Artist Hunger Games:** A pretty wild project in which artists get paid to participate in a hunger-games style game. A DAO of NFT holders have the ability to vote on which artists get removed from the game each round, and can also do silly votes on things like telling the artists where to live or eat. Make it a reality show kind of thing. I was reminded of [Mark](https://www.ted.com/talks/mike_merrill_how_i_became_the_world_s_first_publicly_traded_person) [Merrill](https://www.wired.com/2013/03/ipo-man/), who famously sold off shares of himself.
* **CryptoTaco:** A point-of-sale tool for merchants to accept crypto for payments without having to worry about keys or wallets or whatever. Uses [Magic's](https://magic.link/) tools to onboard merchants using their email addresses. These guys had a lot of enthusiasm, but I'm not sure they're fully aware of how busy this space is. Hasn't bitpay been doing this since 2013 or something?
* **QuestGPT:** Basically [AI Dungeon](https://play.aidungeon.io/main/home) implemented as a Discord chatbot, using DALL-E to create images related to the story which are then minted as NFTs. Pretty nice user experience in the end. Not quite the same degree of control as AI Dungeon gives you though. I was told they use multiple AIs (all GPT?) working together to keep track of context/worldstate and regularize the story.
* **Factorial:** Modular libraries/tools for building DeFi protocols, one example being a "liquidation module" for any time you may need to do something analogous to liquidating a user's position.

The following are the finalists who presented at the closing ceremony. These were short talks and it was easy to miss critical details, so this may be quick.

* **Sesame (Winner!):** Allows you to use Ethereum on your phone without internet by sending data over SMS. Has a little wallet interface that can update ETH market price and portfolio value, and lets you send simple transactions.
* **FundPG (Winner!):** A no-loss donation pool that allows users to specify some percentage of their yield to go to public goods.
* **Krypto Kredit:** Some sort of credit score platform using [Huma](https://huma.finance/). Kind of missed the details.
* **Bitcoin Vitalik's Vision:** Fork of the OP stack to post data on Bitcoin, inspired by ordinals of course. Team answered a question about their experience by saying "it sucks to build on Bitcoin".
* **Swappy (Winner!):** Token swaps using natural language queries. You type in "Swap 5 USDC on Ethereum for MATIC on Polygon" and it parses it with GPT, prompts you if you're missing anything, constructs the actual details of the swap, lets you visualize and confirm it, then executes.
* **Rhinestone:** My notes on this literally say "something something account abstraction" sorry.
* **Slang:** Lets you write a single command to generate code to integrate with Ceramic (decentralized data storage) as if it were a web2 database.
* **Inheritable:** Web3 wills for inheritance. Puts inheritances in a Merkle tree for verifying claims. Lets you establish a group of Witnesses who attest/vote that you're dead to start the inheritance process.
* **BaZaarK (Winner!):** I believe this was about selling an NFT but using ZP proofs to do so without revealing all of its traits. May find some specialized use cases.
* **MyMule:** Virtual pet game with a 3D environment where the pets are NFTs. If you interact with it regularly and keep it happy, it prints some ERC20 tokens for you. If you let its happiness bar go to zero then it dies.
* **Synesthesia:** Collecting music NFTs isn't as fun as JPEG NFTs because of the difference in medium. This project creates generative art for each piece of music based on its metadata to make catchy pictures to go along with them.
* **ZKpoEx (Winner!):** This provides a way for auditors to create a ZK proof that an exploit (generally agnostic to the type of exploit) exists, without revealing the specific details of how it works. Good way to do responsible disclosure. Probably my favorite out of the finalists.
* **Tribe.Credit:** P2P lending protocol. You can deposit some capital, then it connects to your phone's contact list and you can say how much you'd be willing to lend that person. If they borrow from you, you don't get to see who exactly it is or how much. If they don't repay you then identity gets revealed and they get kicked out.
* **GasPay (listed as Gasly elsewhere):** Simple token swap tool that just adds the ability to pay for gas in whatever token you want.
* **Denoted:** A medium/hackmd/notion kind of writing site that integrates with all sorts of crypto data and analytics tools to create graphs and visualizations embedded in the posts. Generated dynamically so can update over time.
* **M3mber:** I think this is a way to mint an NFT that represents a membership in something with an expiry date (pitched as a way for DAOs to bring in recurring money like a subscription rather than just the one-off token sale). They use ENS domains, with [NameWrapper](https://github.com/ensdomains/ens-contracts/tree/master/contracts/wrapper) to accomplish this; is it only because ENS domains already have expiry built in so they don't have to code it from scratch?
* **GovBlocks:** DAO management platform. Modular design, has useful things you would expect like DAO members being able to start a vote to change a governance parameter.

That was actually the last day. Some people are sticking around for the mountain retreat, but that's not really something to report on. I'll assemble a final review tomorrow and that'll be it!

https://www.veritasanalyticsllc.com/finacial-forensics-news/2023/3/6/law360-op-ed-crypto-is-a-major-question-only-appellate-courts-can-answer

Interesting legal op-ed about the potential future of crypto regulation as the Ripple case progresses through the courts.

TLDR: The conservative supreme court has renewed interest in containing federal agencies to the powers explicitly defined by congress evidenced by WV vs. EPA ruling last year referencing the "major questions doctrine" in the ruling. Regardless of the outcome in lower courts for Ripple vs. SEC, the ruling is likely to be appealed to higher courts and this author at least thinks the SEC's authority over crypto assets falls under the "major questions doctrine" that needs to be decided by congress and could potentially neuter Gensler's further attempts to destroy the industry in the US.

Aaayo! It‚Äôs ya most annoying boy back with mooaar open source software! Now, if you‚Äôre like me, your short term memory is shot due to excessive and repeated blows to the head. If you‚Äôre also like me, your wife makes you aware of that fact no less than 10 times a day‚Ä¶ so you probably take a lot of notes so you don‚Äôt feel stupid, like me. On your phone, the desktop, on the mirror after a shower ‚Ä¶ *Don‚Äôt forget to put on pants today!*

Notes are personal and often contain personal information, subtle details about your life and your extremely valuable intellectual property like your unreleased raps. Are you going to trust that level of information to Evernote!? OneNote!? You know who just bought Evernote? Bending Spoons. You know what Bending Spoons does? AI‚Ä¶ yeah. They want your raps bro! Don‚Äôt even get me started on Microsoft (OpenAI) OneNote! *Ahhhhhhh!*

So, today I present an open source, self hosted, zero knowledge, end to end encrypted note taking app named [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org). Joplin is a full featured notes app with markdown support, image/website/screen clip insertion support and so much more! Syncing between your mobile and desktop can be done with Joplin‚Äôs paid cloud service but they also support S3, Nextcloud, WebDAV, Dropbox, OneDrive or the local filesystem (syncthing?), so you don‚Äôt have to pay more for their cloud if you don‚Äôt want.

They have fully featured, open source apps for Android/iOS and Linux, Windows, Mac and ‚Ä¶ FreeBSD!? *Whoah! So hardcore!* Even the Joplin cloud server software is open source‚Ä¶ ohhh! and ‚Ä¶ and there‚Äôs a terminal app for my fellow shell dwellers out there. You can really feel the nerd love here.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11lo2v3/daily_general_discussion_march_8_2023/jbf8b5h/)

You all know, this bear is a builder. Here are some newish, not-so-well-known Defi protocols. As they are new, they are not battle-tested and deployed capital are potentially at risk. Don‚Äòt ape in with your life savings.

**Numoen.com** \- an AMM on Arbitrum which let you access leverage with no liquidation penality, oracleless. It‚Äòs done as a power perpetual ETH\^2. But there is a price,you pay relatively high funding rates so it‚Äòs rather good for short term trades. 

**Sturdy.finance** \- another leverage protocol. Here you can leverage up DEX pool tokens or alternatively lend your ETH/stables to the one using leverage.

**Contango.xyz** \- you can buy or sell a forward contract, and contango borrows on the fixed-rate markets, swaps on the spot markets, and lends back on the fixed rate markets. Sounds complicated, but also fascinating money lego. Be aware: very early stage, in beta with unaudited contracts!

**Ondo.finance** / **fluxfinance.com**: Ondo is gate-keeped (100k min. deposit), so I‚Äòm not sure if you manage to get into their pools (I‚Äòve not tried it). But if not, you can get relatively high APY (currently) on stables (USDC,USDT or DAI) by depositing into their partner protocol fluxfinance.

**IPOR.io** \- an Inter-protocol Offered Rate for Decentralized Finance. It‚Äòs too complicated to explain it in simple words by myself, so I refer to their elaborate documentation: https://docs.ipor.io/

[u/Ethical-trade](https://reddit.com/u/Ethical-trade):

In the past, Binance launched its own L1 with the Binance Smart Chain.

FTX launched its own L1 with Solana.

But today [Coinbase commits to Ethereum by launching its own L2 on Ethereum](https://twitter.com/coinbase/status/1628760201254903809).

This means than Coinbase's interests are now fully aligned with Ethereum, with bridging of users and capital directly to the Ethereum ecosystem. 

This means that marketing made by Coinbase for its chain will now directly benefit Ethereum.

Eth is this L2's native token, with which gas will be paid.

This fully validates Ethereum's rollup centric roadmap.

[u/etheraider](https://reddit.com/u/etheraider):

While some may find the Coinbase "Base" news underwhelming or would have hoped for something different, the way I see it, this is a huge signal in the crypto space that the number one crypto company in the world is choosing to go all in on building on Ethereum. 

Up until now you could argue Coinbase was "impartial" in its offerings and did not show favoritism amongst coins, but now it seems they are willing to forego impartiality to build on the project they believe in most.

They couldve chosen to enhance lightning network/build an alternative, or build on solana, or the "new" smart contract enabled Cardano, but no they chose Ethereum.

That is something I would consider "significant."

<summary>Ecosystem: u/Maleficent_Plankton goes into detail on the Polygon outage</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11ak2qc/daily_general_discussion_february_24_2023/j9sjnjy/)

**Yesterday's Polygon validator "outage" was wild**:

1. There was a [157-block reorg](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/157-block-reorg-at-block-height-39599624/11388)
1. The [block explorer](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/22/polygon-blockchain-suffers-apparent-outage/) went down for an hour
1. Many validators (at least 25) went out of sync and continued to have issues syncing for 12-24 hours.

It was big enough that:

1. Polygon rushed out a **new governance proposal**, [PIP-9](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-9-performance-benchmark-adjustment/11387/4), and passed it within 12 hours. This proposal reduced validator SLA requirements from 98% back to 95% in order to [save 18-23 validators](https://staking.polygon.technology/validators) from getting offboarded due to missing their checkpoints SLA.
1. The co-founder of Polygon stated that they are exploring **[replacing their entire Bor/Heimdall blockchain consensus protocol](https://twitter.com/mihailobjelic/status/1628926312076423170)** with a single-blockchain solution.

**Background**: What happened is that several Polygon validators experienced sync issues, which then lead to giant cascade of outages for most validators. The reason for the reorg is supposedly [a bug between their Bor and Heimdall layers](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/157-block-reorg-at-block-height-39599624/11388), though the team has yet to give details on the bug.

**Checkpoint SLAs**: Back in Aug 2022, there was a governance proposal, [PIP-4](https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-4-validator-performance-management/9956), to move towards permissionless validation.

> "In its current state, the PoS validator network is not entirely permissionless in that the previously-selected set of validators has largely persisted since testnet."

The proposal added an SLA requirement that 95% of median average of last 700 checkpoints are signed by the validator. If the validator fails to meet the SLA, they are placed in a Grace Period have another 700 checkpoints to meet it. Otherwise, they get offboarded from staking. After 2 months, the SLA increased from 95% to 98%.

**What happened yesterday concerning the checkpoint SLA**:

Due to this rule and validators missing checkpoints yesterday, 25 out of 100 validators were at risk of getting kicked off staking.

The emergency PIP-9 vote to reduce the SLA was passed, saving most of the validators. Only 2 validators got offboarded and 5 more are in the Grace Period.

It's good they're finally taking the reorg issue more seriously, but I think they should've addressed this a long time ago.

<summary>Random: u/austonst is doing the ETHDenver daily recaps</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11bdlrh/daily_general_discussion_february_25_2023/j9xiefc/)

**ETHDenver Day 1**

Last year, I attended ETHDenver and [made a post each day in which I primarily summarized the best talks I heard that day](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/sxm6cx/daily_general_discussion_february_21_2022/hxswh7b/), and also commented a little about my general experiences at the conference. ETHDenver 2023 has now begun, and I intend to do the same this year. As with last year, the first few days are slow: only one stage with talks starting late and ending early. So not too much to cover.

It seems that, also like last year, [all talks are recorded to Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/ethereumdenver), one stream per stage. But for a given talk, figuring out which stage and what timestamp is not trivial. It's not *too* hard either, and for today I figured I'd try tracking down timestamps but I'm really skeptical that I'll want to spend the time on that as the days get longer. If there's one you really want to see, let me know and I can probably find it pretty quick given that I know what the different stages are and can probably recognize the style of a given talk's slides at a glance. But in general I'll link to the schedule page for each talk, which should be enough to point you in the right direction for learning more.

* [Rick Lamanna, Founder of OpenQ](https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/d4ef6cc0-2bea-4408-bc63-72d41993415d/8d679f4b-a4d9-4450-9996-571b694850a2) ([video](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1747797444?t=4h14m2s)) talked about crypto hackathons. Gave some general advice on how to best participate and pursue bounties, and then mentioned some trends such as the prevalence of bounties meaning that hackathon teams are starting to say "if you don't pay a bounty for us to use your tool, we're not going to use it".
* [u/DoubtStarsAreFire and u/htimsk of Luau DAO](https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/c4b2f0e5-058d-4dba-9452-0d4033ef98fb/585f5cdd-dc90-4620-b6ab-12ce4f5bb13f) ([video](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1747797444?t=4h36m16s)) talked about Hodlercon, which needs no introduction here. It was a fun talk about a fun event, good vibes all around. I personally would have been interested in some more of the behind-the-scenes about what it takes to form a Wyoming DAO (and why to do so) and organize a group vacation while maintaining participant pseudonymity, but the conference organizers surprised them last minute with this day-1 timeslot so I know there were some serious time constraints.
* [Brian Wilkes](https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/fbd6c346-8883-4ed6-9220-68bc17f4770e/c32b46bc-57e5-4fe0-b3df-500718789823) ([video](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1747797444?t=5h2m43s)) gave a nice overview of zero knowledge proofs as applied to Ethereum scaling. Nothing particularly new to me, but I think it could be a nice overview or refresher for many.
* [Josh Forman of ShapeShift DAO](https://events.ethdenver.com/eden23/attendease/networking/experience/a1236544-05ff-43a9-868e-294cc40eca14/e0b04682-d3a7-4757-87a4-4595a63decd7) ([video](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1747797444?t=5h26m50s)) covered ShapeShift's experience operating as a DAO, and in particular how they fared during a period of serious bear market financial woes. There are some good general insights into DAO structure and operation that I found myself able to relate to the EVMavericks DAO. Some of his main lessons: be clear about your governance process, don't try to figure out too much ahead of time, keep open and transparent communication, leadership and hierarchy can exist but should be delegated (and can be revoked) by the community.

On a personal note, it's kind of amazing how much I expect my experience at ETHDenver will be different this year. Last year I knew nobody personally and was generally content to fill my days with nothing but listening to talks and occasionally chatting with strangers. But this year? I didn't go half an hour before I started bumping into folks I know. I have [a project](https://www.aestus.live/) that I can explain to people who ask what I've been working on (and they seem to find it very interesting (!), but I need to stop assuming that everyone knows how staking and MEV work). I tentatively have a hackathon team (with folks from this community) for a project I think will be bite-sized but still quite valuable. And I need to juggle driving back home occasionally for some classes I'm taking, so I've accepted I'm going to have limited free time this next week. But it'll just be packed so full of fun things!

EDIT: Oh yeah, I also have the EVMavericks t-shirts for those who signed up on Discord. I won't be lugging around the huge box everywhere I go, but I'll try to set aside multiple timeslots when I can set up shop in one spot, let everyone know, and hand them out. Got 100 EVMavs stickers to hand out too.

Can't believe there's this many upvotes. Off the top of my head I can think about:

* Finalizing the Merge Event end of March kicking off a major staking reshuffling for probably the first and last time in the networks history. Every single LSD that has a shot need to make their move in the next 2-6 months or possibly never gain share again. Keeping an eye on RPL, BTRFLY, FXS, SWISE for possible shorter term catalysts.
* Upcoming Arbitrum token event, huge amount of new protocols launching on Arbitrum daily lately.
* Launch of final Scroll Network Open Testnet on Goerli announced just today: <https://twitter.com/Scroll_ZKP/status/1630258973856395264>
* Polygon ZKEVM launching March 27: <https://twitter.com/sandeepnailwal/status/1629736205720977408>
* Optimism TVL continuing to grow, Synthetix and Velodrome updates in the works.
* Base (Coinbase) announcement, dapps and onboarding sooon
* Starkware should continue to drip out news/updates as all these other L2 catalysts take shape, still waiting on their main net launch
* New Rocketpool LSD built on top of RPL to scale Rocket Pool and decentralized staking <https://twitter.com/NodeOperators/status/1630310094981468161>
* ZK Sync onboarding dapps getting ready for their main net launch (soon tm)
* Blur passing Open Sea in volume for many days now, currently lots of active farming possibilities for useless JPGS
* Yuga Labs announcing new NFT project with Bitcoin Ordinals
* Sensible EU stablecoin and defi adoption
* SEC fights against everyone claiming it's a security

This bear market is honestly so much harder to keep track of developments than the last one. All you could do last bear was take a Maker CDP loan and wait for Michael Saylor to buy Bitcoin. Maybe price action stinks but you can never say crypto is boring.

[Edit] Also just remembered Spotify NFTs, Starbucks Polygon NFT rollout in progress, and some of my Reddit WSB NFT's getting a nice premium lately.

[u/cryptOwOcurrency](https://reddit.com/u/cryptOwOcurrency):

Money should be boring. The fact that we had exciting money for a few years (bootstrapping/awareness phase of Bitcoin, then of Ethereum) is a marvel in the history of money.

If you think about it, new types of money don't pop up very often. In the history of money, we've only really had three major types, invented in 6000 BC, 600 BC, and 2008 CE.

* Physical barterable commodities as monies (backed by physical utility, 6000 BC)
* Trust-based monies (backed by their utility in abstracting away the trade of these cumbersome physical commodities by instead trading surrogate notes representing promises made by a trusted authority, 600 BC)
* Self-sovereign monies (monies that exist nowhere and everywhere as information that polices itself as it floats around, backed by their utility in eliminating the need for surrogacy or trust in creating abstract monies, 2008 CE).

You could argue that the jump from gold-backed notes to fiat notes was another fundamental evolution of money, but in any case we have been very lucky to live through this incredibly special decade.

So now begins the long, boring process of executing on the existing roadmap, and integrating Ethereum with the old, boring economy. We've had our big bang moment for this three thousand year period - perhaps in another three thousand years civilization will come up with yet another fundamentally new type of money and we'll see another big bang (thousands of years from now, quantum physics may allow us to have conversations with the laws of physics and directly ask those laws of physics to enforce certain constraints on our reality, a.k.a. "magic").

In three thousand years though, if the word "I" still makes sense to describe me, if I am even aware at that point of the events taking place on planet Earth in the material plane, and humans do invent a fourth type of money, at that point I probably won't care.

<summary>OPSEC: u/Tricky_Troll has some spiel about spammers and the report button</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11d4bra/daily_general_discussion_february_27_2023/ja9t6dn/)

Thanks for those of you vigilantly reporting the spam post on the front page. A quick dive into the user posting it and the other user commenting in support of the scam found a history of similar posts with the same free reddit awards. Don't trust any supposed uncollateralised DeFi protocols. They're almost certainly a scam unless basically everyone is talking about such a breakthrough.

Reminder of things to look out for in identifying spam and scams on Reddit:

**Spam posts: (if yes it's probably a scam)**

- Did they gain a lot of upvotes in the first 20 mins and then stop gaining traction?
- Does the user history have lost of similar posts or low effort comments about the same product posted by different users?
- Does the post have lots of low tier Reddit awards with relatively few upvotes?
- Does the user have low karma or karma farming indications like having a history of posting in random or low effort subs?
- Does the user and other users commenting in support of the post have a generic usernames with a shared pattern such as "AmazingReindeer123" or "GlowingPancake4679"?

Aside from this, there are some basic rules such as:

- If someone you don't know DM'd you it's probably a scam. Even if you want to be polite and respond to an unexpected DM, don't reveal any info or click any links until you're sure they are legit.
- If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
- If something raises even just one of the above flags, do some googling and delve into who else is talking about it. If you're seeing no organic looking chat about it then it's probably a scam.

Please remember to use the report button! In a sub with active mods multiple reports always signals to the mods that something needs investigating.

For those of you who are interested, this is the user who posted it and take a look and see if you can see the patterns of a scammer in their posts and post history. <https://reddit.com/user/SpicateHammer451>

Stay safe out there, folks!

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/11evx0c/daily_general_discussion_march_1_2023/jah8knp/)

My brother: So how's it going with that secret little thing you are doing with Ethereum, that miner sitting on your desk? You must be very smart how do you manage it? Must be a lot of work.

Me thinking: Oh that's right I'm running a validator I almost forgot.

That thing is still running perfectly turning dust into ETH without looking at it for months. Yes, staking is very hard and mind consuming. All I do is wait for my phone to prompt an update and then I run the ethstaker wizard after a few weeks. I am very sramt!

This week I managed to get my coworker into solo staking without telling him I am one myself, but I think he knows. Dude is already heavily invested in getting the best performance out of his machine. What a nerd (He's actually a very nice guy that just loves computers). Tells me he has a lot of unused parts freshly bought just because they were off price. He was flabbergasted about the low specs needed and was kind of disappointed. I guess he was expecting to run some sort of data center in his home?

Maybe I'll tell him to run a Solana node instead, if he really wants to drown in debt and get no profit at all (even run at a loss). Good thing is that he understands. He immediately linked the correlation about decentralization needing easy hardware to work the most efficient. Can't expect normal people to run data centers right? They have the money, but not the technical knowledge. They do not want a beefy machine taking their electricity and bandwidth away. These were his exact words, and I was astounded by his quick thinking.

I wanted to direct him to the right sources to run a validator but he was already talking about running Geth and Lighthouse and was talking about all sorts of Linux command stuff. He was already smarter then me about validating in one day. I guess he's going to be just fine.

Coworker, if you manage to cross this post and recognize me. Doxx me and I will tell your mother!!

<summary>u/superphiz has a disclosure to make but it still putting values first</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/113jhtv/daily_general_discussion_february_16_2023/j8t3bo9/)

I want to disclose that I've contracted with EY to offer community education regarding their Nightfall and Starlight products for a few months. This isn't a full time job, just an agreement to spend more time learning about Nightfall and Starlight, then sharing what I've learned.

Let me give you some idea what this means. My credibility to the community is the most important thing I have in crypto, so I'll never do or say anything that would degrade that credibility. Many people who know and trust me hold that trust because I'm extremely selective about things I talk about. I focus on highly aligned projects that add value to the whole ecosystem and don't extract value for anyone. You might know that EY's privacy tools led by Paul Brody's team fill that niche for me, and I'm very confident about that fit after knowing Paul several years.

My intention is to learn more and share more about Nightfall and Starlight and help them find the traction they deserve and I hope you'll join me in this quest. If these tools succeed in the market, Ethereum will be the greatest beneficiary.

I need you to know that I can't be bought. I'm agreeing to this contract because it's good for the web3 community, our community, Ethereum, and EY. I believe that any greater knowledge we develop about these products will benefit all parties in the long run.

I will always continue to do my best to earn your trust as I find the best tools and opportunities to share with other Ethfinanciers, but I also need you to put your own judgement first. Ask yourself if I'm doing things that make sense for all of us or if I've lost my way. Follow your own good judgement, not mine. <3

> We are always happy and willing to be ambassadors for the benefits of decentralisation and how that can provide a deep benefit for all those involved. So it is with great pleasure that we want to relay that Coinbase Ventures has invested in the protocol. We recently announced their intentions to join the oDAO, so this is just another step in them willing to back a decentralised staking protocol such as Rocket Pool.
  
"We're excited to announce that Coinbase Ventures is deepening its partnership with Rocket Pool via a direct investment into RPL in addition to its proposed entry into the oDAO. Coinbase Ventures also plans to use their RPL and ETH to spin up their own Rocket Pool minipools."

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/114c6on/daily_general_discussion_february_17_2023/j8w36bk/)

I‚Äôm in a discussion with a community member that I respect very much, yet strangely we do not seem to agree on something. 

Question for the fam:

If Coinbase would start spinning up Rocket Pool minipools instead of regular validators from today on, would this be good, bad or neutral for decentralization?

Please limit the discussion to this question about decentralization only. I don‚Äôt want it to be a value judgement on Rocket Pool. Of course any actor can use it as it is permissionless. This is not a fault of the protocol. Also please don‚Äôt discuss how unlikely or likely it is that Coinbase would do this. It might be very unlikely with all the risks (RPL exposure, regalutory, other). I just want to know if you think my hypothetical question would be good or bad for decentralization

[u/kainzilla](https://reddit.com/u/kainzilla)

You asked me to post my comment in reply to this thread, but I think it might be worth re-writing it suited for some of the answers I see here. I'm going to write this as if the LEB-8 (8 ETH minipools) are in effect, because that is the long term goal. For anyone reading this not familiar with Rocket Pool, the current version of minipools instead has 16 ETH from the minipool operator and 16 ETH taken from the rETH pool. This difference doesn't impact the following statements, with the exception of making the barrier-of-entry lower.

&nbsp;

# Is it good, bad, or neutral for major staking entities to use the Rocket Pool protocol?

**Answer:** I believe the effect on decentralization is neutral, but in spite of that neutral effect from this factor alone I think it would be _actually devastating_ to Ethereum's prospects to shut out large entities, due to runaway centralization behind 2-3 broadly used liquid staking tokens. Here are my thoughts.

&nbsp;

# Important Note: What does Rocket Pool do to help decentralize the network?

1. It lowers the barrier to entry for a solo staker from 32 ETH, down to 8 ETH + a portion of collateral (roughly a 70% reduction in initial capital required).
2. It gives parties interested in acquiring staking services access to a service pool that isn't monopolized by a single entity (it is permissionless).
3. Specifically note that "gives more nodes to smaller stakers" isn't in this list. This will be addressed below.

&nbsp;

# Fallacy 1: Comparing centralized entity Rocket Pool use to centralized entities not using Rocket Pool

* The protocol is permissionless, and you cannot prevent any size staker from using it.
* The permissionless feature is non-negotiable, as otherwise centralization is a factor and the protocol is pointless.
* Desire to deny large entities from using it is pointless, and large entities staking in RP should be considered a likely outcome.
* Are features #1 and #2 outlined above compromised by large entities using the protocol? I believe these features are not compromised.
* With that in mind, the comparison of centralized entities using Rocket Pool vs. not using it results in a net neutral comparison minus a concern addressed in the next section.
* A much more important comparison when thinking about Rocket Pool usefulness is "How does this compare to the situation without any Rocket Pool?"

&nbsp;

# Fallacy 2: Increased node counts for centralized entities using Rocket Pool

Some comments here point to the fact that small stakers can obtain a 4x node power "multiplier" against large staking entities, and that large staking entities entering the picture defeats this purpose. This is a fallacy, however:

* **If you could** engineer a Rocket Pool protocol where you could magically keep out large-entity stakers, you could then tout "increased node counts for small stakers" as a decentralization-increasing feature of Rocket Pool, but that feature would only function up to the number of small node operators you would have available in the pool. Once that pool of small stakers runs out however, no further rETH could be created.
* Any demand for staking services beyond what rETH capacity exists would then likely flow over to centralized staking entities outright. Meaning that they would be spinning up more nodes, _just as if they had spun them up from rETH-provided funds_. It would literally just end up a 1:1 conversion.
* The end result of this hypothetical scenario where you block out large stakers, is that you have lost:
    1. The permissionless feature, and more importantly,
    2. you've seriously handicapped the value your accessible-to-all staking services access pool due to the low ceiling of possible funds, and the fact that you just forced a huge number of customers over to centralized entities providing liquid staking tokens.

&nbsp;

The same scenario effectively plays out if you make the comparison of centralized entities using RP vs. RP not existing:

* In this scenario where Rocket Pool doesn't exist, it's once again a very, _very_ safe assumption that people whom are already comfortable delegating their funds for staking on the network, would instead use centralized services for their staking instead.
* This means that it's safe to assume that all funds flowing into rETH in the centralized-entities RP scenario would instead just be... with those centralized entities you're concerned with.
* Now, in this scenario, there isn't an accessible-to-all staking services market at all, and it's almost 100% guaranteed that one staking service is going to become popular on a runaway level purely due to the convenience of having a single liquid staking token. Lido almost did this on accident purely by being early to market and being able to expand rapidly.

&nbsp;

Considering those two scenarios, node counts for any of these scenarios are **irrelevant and are not a factor in comparing any situation for Rocket Pool**. The fact is, Rocket Pool _will_ actually give a slight node-power advantage to decentralization, but only by virtue of feature #1 - _the reduced barrier-to-entry._ There is no scenario where Rocket Pool increases the amount of power a centralized entity has in comparison to Rocket Pool not existing, or locking centralized entities out.

# The actual strength of Rocket Pool decentralization

So what's the actual strength of Rocket Pool? It's specifically item #2, the accessible-to-all staking services pool. The lowered barrier to entry for actual node-operators at 8 ETH is to be frank pretty awesome and amazing, and it's going to let a lot more people into the ETH staking ecosystem, but the point that people keep missing about the accessible-to-all staking services pool that is provided is that it **keeps the biggest liquid-staking token out of the hands of a single entity**, or at the very least provides a nearly-unstoppable competitor. If Rocket Pool didn't exist, staking-services users would have **nowhere** to send their money except centralizing forces, and what's more is that small operations wouldn't be able to attract staking-services customers for shit - nobody would use little-known liquid-staking tokens, and the small operations would get crushed on margins by the big operations.

Every centralized entity that joins this accessible-to-all pool makes it that much harder for any centralized entity to monopolize the liquid-staking-token market, and even better, the protocol itself isn't really able to use it's own dominance of the liquid-staking market to try and shut out competitors except by trying to provide better service to keep people using rETH - so even competitors will still be able to rise up if they make something truly great. The protocol can't blacklist competing liquid-staking tokens on the protocol's (non-existent) exchange, the protocol can't make back-room deals to give more favorable staking percentages to special, favored customers, the protocol can't lock out small staking providers that the big providers don't like.

Rocket Pool can't actually shut out centralized or large entities by design, and it also shouldn't because doing so is inherently a bad idea. Any centralization of node operators on the Rocket Pool protocol would have existed without Rocket Pool, and if you try and shut them out that money gets transferred _right over to external centralized entities anyways_. Rocket Pool's design has likely averted a scenario where a few major exchanges dominated the entire staking services market on the Ethereum chain, which... to be honest, I think would have truly killed the decentralization angle and left us with little claim to security.

> Anyone with an ounce of understanding about economies knows why a DEFLATIONARY currency could never work as the standard.

As the standard for what? Buying eggs and bread? Paying people's salaries? Investing in stuff? Sure. In that case, a deflationary, value-appreciating currency is bad. Thankfully that's not what Ether is.

> We need money to lose value over time to deincentivise people sitting on savings.

The first and foremost job of Ether as an asset is to provide economic security to Ethereum. "Anyone with an ounce of understanding" about that realizes it'd be dumb to devalue this asset on purpose. Ether is collateral money, not debt money. Having the value of your collateral go up gives you more bandwidth to participate in the economy by doing more stuff you otherwise couldn't

> Only when money is used does it lube up the economy by providing cash flow for industry.

Again that's not really Ether's job to do that, but even then it still does it well inside the Ethereum economy: it's deflationary BECAUSE it's being used. "Anyone with an ounce of understanding" quickly realizes this cause and effect relationship and doesn't invert it by claiming being deflationary causes people to not use it.

Ethereum sells blockspace and blockspace accessories. This blockspace is *worth* something, people are willingly paying for it, choosing to burn their precious deflationary ETH in exchange for it. There is no "bad money drives out good" when it comes to buying blockspace, thanks to EIP-1559.

I'm tired of these takes that miss out on all the nuance. "ETH deflation bad because deflation encourages hoarding" is one of them. And yes, "ETH deflation good because supply goes down = line go up" is another one. It's a cringe meme responding to Bitcoin's equally cringe "capped supply = sound money" meme.

The truth is fundamentally, whether the supply goes up or down doesn't affect the velocity of ETH. Whether supply goes up or down, it's all just an accounting trick that doesn't change the fact that value ultimately flows from *users* (paying for blockspace) into the pockets of *holders* (who are likely to be staking, directly or indirectly). You're not magically gonna turn a hoarder into a user if you increase issuance, because that hoarder is already staking anyway.

It's quite a brilliant feature of eip 1559.

If demand for blockspace falls below a certain threshold, ETH issuance goes up while gas prices go down. This has the effect of making it more likely for more people to use ETH, bringing us back to more demand for blockspace.

If demand for blockspace is above a certain threshold, ETH issuance goes ultrasound. More ETH fees are burned instead of given to validators.

If staking becomes extremely desirable, and more and more people stake,  staking rewards APY falls, and the threshold of blockspace demand required for fee burns increases.

If staking becomes less desirable and more and more people unstake, staking APY increases and the threshold for fee burning falls.

It's a completely automated, decentralized monetary policy which favors equilibrium. Nothing else on earth like it.

Ethereum eip 1559 increases incentive to secure the network in a way that avoids inflating the supply, without being 100% reliant on market forces such as gas fees. Unlike Bitcoin security which will eventually become completely enslaved to the wills and fluctuations of the market, and without sufficient fees (blockspace demand) will become more and more centralized and less and less secure.

Very interesting speech just given by Augustin Carstens, the General manager for the BIS. Pay close attention to the last paragraph/bolded text. They totally understand the power of shared ledgers/opensource/composable. They just want to centralize it and own it.

edit: formatting; summarizing a little bc the kicker comes at the end of a wall of text.

&#x200B;

> A unified ledger is a digital infrastructure with the potential to combine the monetary system with other registries of real and financial claims. It would need to be a public-private partnership with a clear division of roles, and where the central bank is tasked with underpinning the trust in money.  
>  
> Like smartphone platforms, a unified ledger allows various components to work seamlessly together. But unlike them, it is enabled by open architecture that promotes financial inclusion and greater competition.  
>  
> Such a ledger allows for the use of smart contracts and composability. A smart contract is a computer program that executes conditional "if/then" and "while" commands. Composability means that many smart contracts, covering multiple transactions and situations, can be bundled together, like "money lego".  
>  
> With these new functionalities, any sequence of transactions in programmable money can be automated and seamlessly integrated. This reduces the need for manual interventions that delay transactions and reduces dependency on intermediaries, and also allows for simultaneous and near-instant payments and settlement.  
>  
> Greater interoperability and automated transfers could ultimately benefit consumers through more convenient and cheaper products that are better tailored to their needs, thereby enhancing financial inclusion.  
>  
> These foreseeable gains may just be the tip of the iceberg of additional transformations. Think about how the smartphone displaced digital cameras. It was not because it takes better pictures, but because it's easier to share these pictures with friends through the same device.  
>  
> **Importantly, programmability and composability do not require decentralised or permissionless platforms. All the potential benefits I just outlined can be achieved in permissioned platforms with various degrees of centralisation.** What really brings the benefits of these projects together is the use of money as a means of payment and settlement. As the provider of the ultimate settlement asset in the economy, the central bank therefore has an important role to play in the governance of a unified ledger. But it would do so in partnership with other public agencies as well as with private sector participants.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10xn2mv/daily_general_discussion_february_9_2023/j7wt9wm/)

The one sane person at the SEC seems to have little influence - she's echoed this sentiment for a few years now and not much has changed. Not a criticism to her, more a comment on the SEC's approach to regulation being firmly entrenched

<https://twitter.com/HesterPeirce/status/1623796583807451139>

Today, the SEC shut down Kraken‚Äôs staking program and counted it as a win for investors. I disagree and therefore dissent.

Kraken operated a service through which its customers could offer their tokens up for staking. The customers earned returns, and the company earned a fee. The Commission argues that this staking program should have been registered with the SEC as a securities offering. Whether one agrees with that analysis or not, the more fundamental question is whether SEC registration would have been possible. In the current climate, crypto-related offerings are not making it through the SEC‚Äôs registration pipeline. An offering like the staking service at issue here raises a host of complicated questions, including whether the staking program as a whole would be registered or whether each token‚Äôs staking program would be separately registered, what the important disclosures what be, and what the accounting implications would be for Kraken.

We have known about crypto staking programs for a long time. Although it may not have made a difference, I should have called for us to put out guidance on staking long before now. Instead of taking the path of thinking through staking programs and issuing guidance, we again chose to speak through an enforcement action, purporting to ‚Äúmake clear to the marketplace that staking-as-a-service providers must register and provide full, fair, and truthful disclosure and investor protection.‚Äù[1] Using enforcement actions to tell people what the law is in an emerging industry is not an efficient or fair way of regulating.[2] Moreover, staking services are not uniform, so one-off enforcement actions and cookie-cutter analysis does not cut it.[3]

Most concerning, though, is that our solution to a registration violation is to shut down entirely a program that has served people well. The program will no longer be available in the United States, and Kraken is enjoined from ever offering a staking service in the United States, registered or not. A paternalistic and lazy regulator settles on a solution like the one in this settlement: do not initiate a public process to develop a workable registration process that provides valuable information to investors, just shut it down.

More transparency around crypto-staking programs like Kraken‚Äôs might well be a good thing. However, whether we need a uniform regulatory solution and if that regulatory solution is best provided by a regulator that is hostile to crypto, in the form of an enforcement action, is less clear.

<summary>Random: u/busterrulezzz found an interesting mental model to describe the relationship between Ethereum and civil society</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10yhsb2/daily_general_discussion_february_10_2023/j7zb05g/)

This is going to be long, sorry.

I think I've found an interesting mental model to describe the relationship between Ethereum and civil society, especially with respect to the (sometimes) irrational hatred for the protocol.

I believe that as a public good, Ethereum is like a large public transportation project.

Indeed, every Western city that has decided to invest in such projects has faced absolutely incredible opposition. In Bordeaux, France, the tramway project caused protests, arguments, political riff raff - a non-negligible portion of the population swore that they would never use the tramway, because they were opposed to it from the beginning.

Now, two decades later, Bordeaux is a model for major European cities, and the opposition has disappeared. The ridership of the tramway is extraordinary, which suggests that even the most furious opponents have pounded on their pride and are using the service when they need it.

It's the same everywhere. When London wanted to reduce the number of cars in the city center, the anger of the citizens was incredible. Twenty years later, no one would go back. I experienced it personally in Montreal: the current mayor built bike lanes on major commercial arteries, which led opponents to predict the imminent death of downtown. Four years later, the city's liveliest thoroughfares are the ones that received new bike lanes, and absolutely no one is calling for a reversal - even the most rabid opponents.

This got me thinking. Why were these citizens so fiercely opposed to a public good? On what arguments was their opposition based?

I went back and read their open letters and angry tweets. Basically, the opponents were concerned that the loss of parking space would hurt business, create traffic congestion, and make the city ugly (!).

Literally none of this has happened. In fact, the exact opposite has happened. 

Now, let's ask ourselves why these arguments overrode the emotions of the opponents. My theory is that it is a "failure of imagination": an inability to imagine the world differently, to find creative solutions that are outside the current paradigm. They are stuck in the only model they know, and are unable to believe that another world is possible. 

There is also, in my opinion, an element of ego. Many of the opponents were at the top of the social pyramid - wealthy businessmen, popular TV hosts, bourgeois, etc. The world as it is has been extremely generous to them, so why change it? Besides, the idea that a revolution could arise from outside the system that brought them into the world is frightening for them. It means that their privileges are not so solid after all.

I believe Ethereum is in a similar situation.

Our protocol is a public good. It belongs to its participants, and literally any human being can deploy an application on it. This is an absolutely revolutionary idea from the outside - have you seen what Vitalik looks like? It's impossible that a nerd like that, with no credibility in high society, has come up with something good. So his creation is necessarily a fraud, which must be fought

So these opinion leaders declare Ethereum an enemy to be fought, and the citizens used to following what the top of the pyramid tells them jump on the bandwagon, without asking themselves if their fight is really relevant.

TL;DR : Ethereum will (hopefully) follow the same trajectory as public transit projects.

<summary>Ecosystem: u/mgr37 explains the use of the validator mnemonic after the withdrawal address is set</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1108k4a/daily_general_discussion_february_12_2023/j88acu5/)

Good question !

As I understand it, yes the seed will no longer be useful for normal operation:

- once withdrawal address set, it can't be changed
- partial withdrawal will be automated to the withdrawal address.
- exit is triggered with validator keys (the one used to run the validator client) and actual full withdrawal will be automated to the withdrawal address.


BUT you would still need it for:

- derivating new validator keys from the same seed (not compulsory, you could use a new seed for new validators, but might be handy -> see next point)
- re-generate your validator keys in case they got lost (i.e. staking rig hard drive crash). I think that's the main reason to keep the seed (and use the same seed when rolling new validators). 
You could backup the keys instead but it's easier to keep a seed backup than keys backup IMO.

<summary>Ecosystem: u/Blueberry314E-2 does some research on the SEC vs BUSD</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1111020/daily_general_discussion_february_13_2023/j8euz36/)

Some of my own research on SEC vs BUSD:

The New York Department of Financial Services (DFS) has told Paxos to stop making its own version of BUSD (a digital currency) "as a result of several unresolved issues related to Paxos‚Äô oversight of its relationship with Binance in regard to Paxos-issued BUSD."

Paxos‚Äô BUSD product is **related to, but separate from**, Binance‚Äôs self-issued *Binance-pegged BUSD*. Binance‚Äôs *self-issued BUSD*, which is not directly regulated by NYDFS, **is independently wrapped and issued by the crypto exchange on blockchains beyond Ethereum**. In other words, Binance can take a single Paxos-issued BUSD, create an *analogous BUSD* on another blockchain (like Binance‚Äôs own blockchain, for example), and freeze a corresponding Paxos-issued BUSD. ‚ÄúThe Department has not authorized *Binance-Peg BUSD* on any blockchain, and *Binance-Peg BUSD* is not issued by Paxos."

So the issue here is not 'true' BUSD issued by Paxos. The problem is that Binance was sneakily issuing alternative *unregulated BUSD* on it's own blockchain and others, and passing them off as the real, regulated, Ethereum based BUSD issued by Paxos.

Paxos has told its customers that it will end its relationship with Binance for BUSD. The DFS is watching Paxos closely to make sure it can handle redemptions properly, following new safety rules. **It's important to know that Paxos was allowed to make BUSD on the Ethereum blockchain, but** ***Binance-Peg BUSD*** **is not approved or made by Paxos.** There are no restrictions from the DFS for New York companies to list or trade the existing Paxos-issued BUSD.

Looks to me like Binance is to blame here, SEC is just trying to clean up their mess.

<summary>Random: u/Lazy_Physicist has a cool idea for once Stakewise V3 launches</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/111vdwx/daily_general_discussion_february_14_2023/j8kik5e/)

Regulatory news aside, I've just had a thought. Stakewise v3 would allow node operators to set up vaults with whitelisted addresses for allocators. This in theory allows us to set up vaults where only holders of EVMavericks/EIPandas/etc. are allowed to deposit ETH into. I'm sure there are others here like myself who have overallocated on the hardware for our own staking rigs or have extra bandwidth. If I were to use swise I would probably set up multiple vaults if I didn't have to provide any collateral to do so. A vault or two to stake for "members" who can't or won't solo stake free of commission, then however many public vaults I want to run with a commission. This could be an interesting way for communities to drive value to their NFT Collections.


Edit: SWISE staking taking a share of the fees will probably factor into how feasible this is

<summary>Community: u/cheeky-gorilla reports back from the Edelweiss Interop Workshop</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10rigcl/daily_general_discussion_february_2_2023/j6wdzn9/)

By now you've probably heard that last week was the [Edelweiss Interop Workshop](https://twitter.com/peter_szilagyi/status/1620095331252981760) (the successor to the [Amphora Interop](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/10/15/amphora-merge-milestone)), where Ethereum's core devs spent a week together in the mountains to work on withdrawals, 4844 (aka proto-danksharding) and EOF.

I was invited to join due to my work on the [Protocol Guild](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and - even though it still feels like a dream - I wanted to share my experience, especially as someone without a technical background.

Was the workshop a success? Absolutely. To quote a core dev, "we left with a flawless Capella/Shanghai fork", and there was a 4844 testnet with all but one client team! 4844 in July? üëÄ

I'll admit I was INCREDIBLY nervous going into this event, I couldn't sleep properly for days in advance - I was literally going to meet the majority of my heroes, and I was 100% going to be the dumbest person in the room at all times.

Well, I can happily confirm that "you should never meet your heroes" does NOT apply to Ethereum's core protocol contributors. These are some of the most interesting (and surprisingly funny) people I've ever met, and even though there was [a lack of diversity](https://twitter.com/trent_vanepps/status/1620438540328005633), they came from all over the world, with all sorts of different backgrounds. And despite the fact that the price of ETH is never discussed on ACD calls, I can confirm that Ethereum's core devs are bullish: I heard more than one conversation about [ultra sound money](https://ultrasound.money/), and [RatioGang](https://ratiogang.com/) was also strongly represented! I'm an introvert, but everyone was so incredibly welcoming and kind, I never had any issues talking to people.

Overall, the passion these individuals have for Ethereum is genuine and contagious, and I feel more confident than ever in Ethereum's ability to execute its [roadmap](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1588669782471368704) while staying aligned to its values of decentralization, openness and long-term thinking.

Other highlights included organizing a core dev run one morning, and as a pretty hardcore privacy enthusiast, I even had the pleasure of giving privacy tips to Vitalik! Oh and there was that one time that Danny Ryan wasn't allowed at dinner because he was wearing flip flops üòõ

I'll end with one note of encouragement for those who need it: if I can end up at this kind of event, then so can you. To quote Danny Ryan, "doors are wide open at Ethereum". My "door" was the Protocol Guild booth at Devcon Bogota, where I asked Trent and Tim if they needed any operational help with the Guild, and turns out they did! (For the introverts, I passed by the booth 3-4 times before I gathered up the nerve to talk to them - don't let shyness gatekeep your passions!). Now I spend my time coordinating / helping with the Guild's [v2 architecture](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/5-initial-pilot.html#v2-architecture) upgrade, fundraising and marketing, all without a technical background.

This comment is already much longer than I expected, so I'll end it here. TLDR: everything good about Ethereum is reflected in its core devs, and the barriers to entry are probably lower than you think!

<summary>Ecosystem: u/Canadiens1993 thinks that US tax laws are inhibiting solo staking</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10scsic/daily_general_discussion_february_3_2023/j730mpx/)

**Unclear Tax Treatment for Staking (USA):  Centralization Vector?**

Let me explain.  Retail has a choice:

\- Staking on, say, Coinbase and it prepares and sends you the requisite tax form every year.  You forego a small percentage of your staking rewards in exchange for this service, and you must  entrust your ETH with a regulated custodian (centralization risk); or

\- per current IRS position, solo stakers must record revenue for each attestation (every 6 min), for each block produced (random) and tips/MEV (random).  There is a valid legal argument for staking rewards to be taxed when sold (not when received), but the IRS has dismissed it - [https://www.proofofstakealliance.org/12423-posa-response-to-irs-stance-on-staking](https://www.proofofstakealliance.org/12423-posa-response-to-irs-stance-on-staking). So what does this mean in practice.

1. **Taxable income**: Setting aside how to deal with Shanghai and managing price volatility given the queue for withdrawals, you'll need to record revenue every 6min for the ETH received as taxable income (currently: 13329 GWei) at the value on the date/time "received"; and then (and this is where I lose my shit);
2. **Capital Gain/Loss Tax**: if and when you sell ETH in the future you will need to record a capital gain/loss using the cost basis above for that petty 13329 GWei received.  You will never be selling only 13329 GWei.

If you think I just made the case for LSDs, then you understand the problem.  Maybe this can easily fixed with more sophisticated tax software?    **WE NEED TO LOBBY FOR A CHANGE IN THE IRS's TREATMENT OF STAKING REWARDS FOR SOLO STAKERS.**

*Note: I'm not a member of the PoS Alliance and not a tax lawyer or CPA, just a random dude who pays his taxes and truly believes in decentralization and the transformational potential of the Ethereum network.*

<summary>Ecosystem: u/vvpan quells our expectations on the current state of rollups and their future development timeline</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10t6kdg/daily_general_discussion_february_4_2023/j79lvy8/)

I've been known to come off kind of negative about the state of roll-ups. I do think that long-term they are the absolute best way to scale blockchains. Justin Drake the other day blew the minds of all participants of Bankless Bullcase for Ethereum by saying that the synchronous composability between zk rollups is such that different different rollups can combine their liquidity into a single pool and that Danksharding does not break that composability. Yet the key is *long-term.* Optimism, the oldest optimistic rollup, has not yet gotten to fraud proofs and neither has Arbitrum. And ZK is a much much more complex technology that requires highly skilled mathematically skilled developers to implement and will roll out slower at least because there is much more potential for bugs (although Justin Drake said Ethereum research team recently figured out how to add "training wheels" to a rollup). I think [this tweet](https://twitter.com/Scroll_ZKP/status/1621573597566468096) from Scroll zkEVM account is telling about where we are.  
I am not saying this to be a downer, but to say that we have to have realistic expectations. Big announcements for "mainnet" of this or that rollup or some new improvement to one are galore and sometimes I feel like they are borderline disingenuous. I understand their teams - they reach significant personal milestones and they want to share. But a secure decentralized general-puprose rollup of any kind seems to be behind the horizon for now.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10u5d4l/daily_general_discussion_february_5_2023/j7aqft0/)

Hey fellas, wanted to share something we put together recently at defi saver - a dedicated page for various leveraged ETH staking options that you can check out at: [https://app.defisaver.com/recipes/leveraged-staking](https://app.defisaver.com/recipes/leveraged-staking)

We added support for both Aave v3 and the new WETH-based deployment of Compound v3 in the past two weeks and both offered new interesting options for leveraging LSDs vs ETH for amplified staking yield, so we thought this made sense.

For now you can find different (w)stETH/ETH options across Aave v2, v3 and CompV3-WETH in there, as well as the cbETH/ETH combo available in Compound (which is at net negative yield atm because of high pool utilisation).

Next: we'll have a new Morpho-Aave integration live, and after that we expect to see rETH added to Aave v3 on the mainnet \*and\* wstETH added to Aave v3 on Optimism. So you can definitely expect to see a growing number of options there in the coming weeks and months.

Btw, if you check it out, we'd love to hear what else we could add, so please don't hesitate. I also posted an alternative rundown on this on [twitter](https://twitter.com/_nikolajankovic/status/1622183165098971136) / [nitter](https://nitter.net/_nikolajankovic/status/1622183165098971136) (nitter isn't loading this for me atm, did twitter already kill it? :/)

This plan is a critical step forward towards a substantial recovery of assets for all Genesis creditors. In addition, Gemini will be contributing up to $100 million more for Earn users as part of the plan, further demonstrating Gemini‚Äôs continued commitment to helping Earn users achieve a full recovery.

We have been working around the clock since November 16, 2022 to reach this milestone. We greatly appreciate your support and patience during this time. It has allowed us to maximize our efforts on your behalf. There is still much work to be done to complete this process, including further due diligence of Genesis financials and judicial approval of this plan, but we are confident that we now have a framework in place to execute on. Thank you for putting your trust in us during this challenging time.

We will continue to update you on how to participate in the recovery, key dates, information, and milestones as they unfold on the Earn status page.

Onward and Upward,

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10woz0p/daily_general_discussion_february_8_2023/j7omifz/)

I hope everyone has a great day. The current moment feels like we are caught in a wave of uncertainty due to economic and political constraints and factors but that does not mean you should lose faith in the premise of a decentralized monetary system or this community. 

The doldrums of the crab should not deter you from your belief that ETH  is the best technological investment at this time. This can obviously change in the future due to a new cryptocurrency/blockchain displacing ETH or quantum technology rendering our keys worthless. However it is my belief we are still on the ground floor of an emerging asset class. I remember when I used to tell my school friends to connect with me online but they didn't even have internet access because they were lacking dial up modems on their Windows 95 desktops. I found so many great communities online and made a great many number of friends on the "world wide web" before it became so commonplace as it is now. In the end I honestly do not know if the internet has been a net positive in light of the harmful effects of social media and the ease of scamming.

Sorry for the rambling, but my point is Ethereum and Ethfinance remind me of those mid to late 90s internet moments, which leads me to think that $10k USD is a ridiculously low valuation after withdrawals are enabled. The current period is in the Web 1 phase (Angelfire, Xanga, Yahoo Mail) and not even comparable to Web 2.0. We need some hopium so I am going to prognosticate a low of $15k USD in 2025. Buy now and sell never.

Zero-Knowledge Proof: put simply is

- I know the secret.
- I will not tell you the secret.
- But I can prove to you that I know the secret

and put in even simpler terms:

- your wife is angry at you,
- without giving you any details,
- she proved to you that you did something wrong and she knows it

<summary>OPSEC: u/RooftopPortaPotty investigates the scam that took out a fellow EthFinancier</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10lkzyb/daily_general_discussion_january_26_2023/j5yw3vm/)

Today we will be investigating the scam that took advantage of our friend who came here looking for help yesterday. My inital intent was to remove this campaign from the internet.

Though, as my investigation progressed, I became more and more conscious of the CFAA. I would not discourage anyone who understands the implications from picking up where I left off.

**The Scam**

Loading the domain in your browser will instantly prompt MetaMask to connect. Doing so leads to a fake DEX. You are given a 6 digit ‚ÄòID‚Äô that is displayed on the front page. Below is an example of one of their scam pages.

<https://imgur.com/Wy5NPSb>

This is all over the place. USDT-ERC20, output in ETC. They provide various addresses to deposit your funds. At least one of the addresses provided does not even have an ETH balance ‚Äì without any gas money, these fraudsters were never planning to return any deposits.

I clicked on the button that was a head with headphones, presumably the support button.

<https://imgur.com/s2V6PAW>

You can ‚ÄòEmall‚Äô them at the displayed email address. Visiting the above domain in chrome showed the exact same front end as the scam we‚Äôre dealing with.

Frighteningly, they want you to ‚Äòauthenticate‚Äô.

<https://imgur.com/B9nXvHN>

They ask for your name and email address. Infinitely worse, they want pictures of any forms of your identification, as can be seen below.

<https://imgur.com/iJpMGIj>

Anyone who has completed this form should consider their identity stolen, and contact the appropriate authorities.

**Offense**

To begin to gain some understanding of a website, using ‚Äòview page source‚Äô in your browser is an extremely effective tool.

<https://imgur.com/8q39ows>

The highlighted text is Simplified Chinese for ‚Äòpage loaded‚Äô. *Quite* interesting.

As an attacker, this file upload form offers a massive attack surface. Of course, an experienced intruder knows what to do here.

But for any ethfinanciers who would like to learn more about this, here are some resources [1](https://portswigger.net/web-security/file-upload)[2](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Unrestricted_File_Upload)[3](https://www.aptive.co.uk/blog/unrestricted-file-upload-testing/) or just ask ya boi.

When running a [black box](https://brightsec.com/blog/black-box-penetration-testing/) web application security test, /robots.txt is a critical file to access. This file is used by servers to request that web crawlers such as google not access/archive the list of URLs within the file.

As you might imagine, these often times contain URLs of relative importance. Whether crawlers choose to obey is completely up to them both technically, and legally(not legal advice).

The requested /robots.txt did not directly return any confidential files or directories. Though, it resulted in a fairly signficant information leak.

<https://imgur.com/eJwEEWq>

I unfortunately did not think to translate that Chinese text to English. Do we have any Chinese speaking ethfinanciers who can help out?

Notice that this error leaks a number of file paths on this server.

At the bottom we see that the server uses ThinkPHP 3.2.0, which happens to be vulnerable to a high severity issue.

<https://imgur.com/3l8C9Tf>

I will not fix the URL provided in the description to fit this target simply for the safety of those who do not know exactly what they‚Äôre doing. Be very careful before landing yourself in federal prison.

When learning to attack a system, one thing that has to be reinforced is the idea of enumeration. I cannot find a link to an article that accurately articulates what I wish to convey. I would describe it is as the art of testing ideas, taking notes of oddities, and learning everything you can about your target system.

Here‚Äôs an example. Screenshots were not taken, but I found that files requested that lack the the extension ‚Äò.php‚Äô resulted in the same error shown in /robots.txt. Is it a vulnerability? No. Is it worth noting if you wish to gain a thorough understanding of your target? Yes.

I've seen *lots* of examples of security researchers bringing down scam websites without facing prosecution, but a number of things made me hesitant in this case.

<https://imgur.com/0j1UzE0>

The true ip address of the scammers is protected by Cloudflare. Finding the ip address of servers behind Cloudflare is an eternal challenge for attackers.

<https://scrapeops.io/web-scraping-playbook/how-to-bypass-cloudflare/> seems to be extremely comprehensive and up to date. I tried every technqiue short of signing up for a service that requires an API key. No results, the following provides a fair explanation for that.

<https://imgur.com/iK54QDk>

As [/u/REALJohnBMacLemore](https://reddit.com/u/REALJohnBMacLemore) previously noted, the website was only created a few months ago. Thats always suspicious. What about the domain listed as the support email address?

<https://imgur.com/4xC20qD>

This domain is hosted by Alibaba US. That they dont even provide an abuse contact speaks volumes.

In my brief enumeration efforts, I visisted /index.php, which redirected me to /Pc/Index/index.html.

<https://imgur.com/DDUUiAQ>

The HTML does not render properly, but this is completely different than what we were dealing with before.

<https://imgur.com/wk227MG>

At the bottom of the page we see another support email address. The highlighted text seems to show that the listed website(NOTE: not the scam domain in question) might have been a real company at some point? The registration number certainly does not comply with the new Chinese business registration numbering system, which was in full effect by 2018.

Lets use <https://whois.domaintools.com> again to find some information about this newly discovered forex exchange domain.

<https://imgur.com/2o6PP1v>

The domain name has been used for at least 16 years.

This scam seems to be masquerading as a possibly real, but defunct Chinese forex exchange. Also doubling as a crypto exchange, depending on their target.

[Attribution](https://www.exabeam.com/incident-response/cyber-attribution-essential-component-of-incident-response-or-optional-extra/) has always been a touchy subject in the realm of cyber security, with that type of debate usually reserved for large-scale nation state attacks.

When we consider the prevalent usage of the Simplified Chinese language, a Chinese PHP framework, and Alibaba hosting, Im confident in declaring this a campaign of Chinese origin. Of course, given the lack of sophistication on the part of the scammers, and the lack of geopolitical implications, this is virtually meaningless.

Stay safe, RTPP

<summary>Community: u/DoubtStarsAreFire shares her and Logris's back story</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10n7qyq/daily_general_discussion_january_28_2023/j67f4fp/)

For those of you that are regular readers of Logris‚Äô work and do not know, Logris and I (DoubtStarsAreFire) run *Tokenomics Explained* together. We are partners in all things. Family, life, the website, and now our consulting business. In the beginning, I would minimize, qualify, and categorize all of the work that we have put into our site as, ‚Äúoh we run a blog‚Äù. Probably because when we started *Tokenomics Explained* we didn‚Äôt have a plan. Increasingly, we do, or at least ambition.

# EV Mavericks Podcast:

Listen to the [Layer Zero Podcast #4](https://spotifyanchor-web.app.link/e/VX3ZGDe6Qwb) from the EV Mavericks to hear us talk more about *Tokenomics Explained*, Hodlercon, the Double Logris and our plans for Logris Vaults! Ping us if you'd like to join our BUIDL team at EthDenver.

I felt like we could do a better job explaining the genesis of the blog. Because if you listen we kind of stumble over the answer.

Why am I posting now? The blog has mainly been a space for Logris‚Äô writing. The main reason that I‚Äôm posting is I joined the Bankless Academy writers guild. I‚Äôll be posting content on the website for the next four weeks. I'm calling these contributions Stargazing. There were other options for locations to post my thoughts like Mirror or Medium. I really did think about posting there. But, our blog seemed like the best place. Stargazing will be my additions to ‚ÄúLogris the Blog‚Äù.

Visit [https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-story-of-tokenomics-explained/](https://tokenomicsexplained.com/the-story-of-tokenomics-explained/) to see the whole post.

*Below is a short excerpt.*

# The Backstory

I‚Äôve always heard it said, ‚Äúwrite what you know‚Äù so for a first topic answering the question ‚ÄúHow did Tokenomics Explained start?‚Äù seems appropriate. Logris and I have been asked this exact question several times in interviews or by friends. That is usually a good sign you should write something down.

First, at heart my husband is a writer. When I met him, it wasn‚Äôt something I knew about him. I just thought he was a cute programmer boy that I was meeting to play board games. It‚Äôs taken years for me to come to the realization that he is a writer as well a programmer. I‚Äôm starting here because it gets to the heart of why we began this venture. He became interested in crypto because it combined his interests of computer science, game theory, and economics. Just like you should write about what you know, you should invest in what you know. Back in 2017, most of the social media about crypto was on reddit. This eventually led him to ethtrader and from there to ethfinance. Me, I was along for the ride. He would talk at me about crypto and I would blink at him and say, ‚Äúthose were words‚Äù.

I watched him ride the bull market of 2017 and then the crash. He survived the crypto winter. Eventually the food coin craze hit. All the while, Logris was riding the waves and I was following along or lurking in reddit parlance. Based on my experience and observations in my own house, I thought everyone was spending hours reading, researching, and writing their posts. Over the years, I have learned differently. Thank you reddit shit posters for disabusing me of this notion.

So why did we choose to make a website? In short, it‚Äôs Google‚Äôs fault. Ever since Logris started investing in crypto in 2017, he was a daily visitor and poster to the subreddit. As you know, all the fun in ethfinance takes place in the Daily Discussion Thread. Over the years Logris had made some stellar posts‚Ä¶ in the daily. But, Google doesn‚Äôt index the daily. Top level posts are often reserved for announcements from protocols, highly regarded posts from the daily, or noobs that don‚Äôt know any better.

Why is this important to the story?

TLDR: It‚Äôs all because of Google‚Äôs SEO.

>**For example:** At some point in the past, you may have googled about a question you had. In the search results, there may have been a reddit post with the same question. You'd click the link and find yourself directed to a subreddit about the topic, where knowledgeable people may have already responded to your exact or similar question.

**Since most of the posts on ethfinance happen in the daily thread and not at the top level** (as in the example), **this content is invisible to Google.**

Logris was amassing a treasure trove of content and often wanted to cite it when it became relevant again. This became more pertinent when he came up with the idea for the Double Logris. People started asking about it and wanting to read more about it. His ideas, content, and discussions were disappearing into the ether as it were. So, he started using Google drive to keep track for referral, which was ridiculous. To save time and just generally make the world a better place we decided to create a repository for his writings by making this site.

<summary>Analysis: u/Defacticool just finished studying law and discusses how DAOs fit in existing legal framework</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10o0h5d/daily_general_discussion_january_29_2023/j6dqs2n/)

Hope this is an acceptable place to ask some questions both for the mods and regulars here. 

Last spring I graduated from law school (here in sweden, my degree is an analogue to an LMM) and I wrote my "final paper" on DAO and defi, from a company law and securities law perspective. 

I recently saw and read that paper from /u/Pbrody (hope that's correct) and EY about how the "best" firm classification for DAO's are as Co-operatives. 

And so I thought maybe there would be some interest to see my own research that I spent 6 months on. (Tldr of my conclusion: "Proper" DAOs don't fit any current, swedish, firm classifications and are unable to fit in one even if they wanted to, and securities law is unable to in any way sanction or interactive with fully autonomous swapping protocols such as Uniswap)

So my questions are: 

- Would there be any interest if I posted my paper here? 
- would the mods be alright with me posting it here?
- and finally, does anyone know of a good and accessible site where I could upload my paper and those interested could read/download it? Preferably one where I don't have to dox myself. 

Cheers! I Love this community.

Edit: Thought I should add, I wrote it in english.

Editwo: Just posted it in today's daily: https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10oudh1/daily_general_discussion_january_30_2023/j6iwia0/

In yesterday's daily I asked about interest for sharing my "final exam paper" from when I graduated law school last year. (After looking into it further, I believe the american term for it is something like "masters research paper") 

I got way greater of a response than I anticipated so I'll be sharing it with you in this comment! I hope a mediafire link is allowed. 

Just some heads up that the version I'm linking you isn't the final handed-in version but the penultimate version so there will be some grammatical and spelling errors but nothing that should affect the content. This is so I don't run afoul of any academic policies about sharing examinated material through the wrong channels. (Should be fine, but don't wanna risk it) 

<https://www.mediafire.com/file/tyd530ryrjljst2/DAO_and_DEFI_legal_analysis.pdf/file>

If anyone has any constructive thoughts I genuinely would love to hear them! 

In a comment in response to this one I'll be posting the "Final Remarks" portion, for those that just wants my final take and don't care to trudge through the rest.

<summary>Random: u/LogrisTheBard discusses the crypto education gap</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10pqbiw/daily_general_discussion_january_31_2023/j6ly502/)

So my wife is working on a post this week on web3 education. On that topic I observe there is a labor to impact mismatch between how web3 education functions today. I see too many tutorials on the basics. Each org like BlueDAO, Bankless Academy, CollectiveShift, BoysClub, etc has their own curriculum. Some of it is even pay gated. It's a lot of replicated effort and unless it's paired with a way of access people outside our ecosystem it's having no impact. On the other end there's highly technical documents on exactly how the Beacon Chain works or the scaling strategy for Ethereum or frontier takes like /u/liberosist writes. These are written for the *dozens* of us living at the edge of the frontier. In the middle is a desert of content. Once you get past that entry level content you get chucked into places like /r/cryptocurrency and good luck to you. You're excited by the potential of what you learnt in the entry level content but you're not yet proficient enough to spot the scams. Everyone is passionately shilling you something and telling you why it's the next great thing that's going to kill Ethereum etc. Basically, you're someone else's exit liquidity.

It takes a full market cycle to wisen up. By the time you transition from tourist to settler you've probably lost 90% of your investment into altcoins. Many don't stick around after that and those who leave form a moat of resentment in front of the Rabbit Hole. The abrupt cliff of learning material once you have a Metamask wallet loaded with some ETH is doing a disservice to our space. It's suddenly a space with no map and no Sherpa and you weren't taught spelunking. It's ultimately discouraging people from joining this space and slowing down the adoption of one of the most promising technologies humanity has ever produced.

In the last year I've written a bit more for this entry +1 skill level and a bit less on the frontier but anything I write tends to come off more as entry +3 regardless of my intent or else I don't find it interesting enough to write. My wife is better than me in this regard so I hope web3 does find a space for her to be an educator here. Anything else is a disservice to *humanity*.

<summary>Random: u/Liberosist is cautious not to get overly bullish about long-term ETH issuance trends</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10qm414/daily_general_discussion_february_1_2023/j6r7sq6/)

As [u/15kisFUD](https://reddit.com/u/15kisFUD) [pointed out](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10pqbiw/comment/j6m5xo7/), the sentiment currently is neutral-ish, so it's a good time to talk about things that everyone will laugh at in bull times or be depressed over in bear times. Now, both u/No_Fix_1183 and I got a ton of backlash (or as NoFix says, "[got crucified](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10pqbiw/comment/j6q5foj/)") over the last couple of days for broaching the inevitability of secular bear market for emerging markets, and how they typically happen on narratives years before actual adoption - but there's at least a few people now who are still interested. No one will listen when the bull comes around, so this is our chance. So, I wanted to take the opportunity to talk about a different topic.

When the ponzis spin back up and the mania happens, the ultrasoundmoney cult will be unbearably loud and you'll see all sorts of absurd projections around the burn, deflation and such. Some of you may remember I was skeptical of the numbers being thrown around in 2021 (having myself fallen for them earlier in 2020) - and even had a little debate with Justin Drake here. It may seem absurd now, but numbers like 20%-70% staking APR, 5% deflation were widely accepted, based off clearly unsustainable usage.

Instead, it would be prudent to form a base case now, and use those numbers instead in the future. The first observation you'll see that in ETH terms, total transaction fees outside of manias are [actually relatively constant](https://etherscan.io/chart/transactionfee) \- which is a big narrative violation of the up-only rhetoric you saw in 2021 and will see again in the next bull. (Yes, the mechanisms have changed since EIP-1559, but it's in the same order of magnitude) \[PS, edit: other data sources like Coin Metrics do account for EIP-1559; however, as I mentioned originally, it's in the same order of magnitude\] The $ tx fees are still going up, of course, with a larger economy and higher ETH price. But remember - burn rates, staking rates, MEV are all denominated in ETH, so it doesn't matter.

It's very likely the type of fees in 2020 (when it peaked) and 2021 will never be seen again - for the simple fact that there's orders of magnitude more blockspace available across L2s and alt-L1s - and even more coming with EIP-4844. Nevertheless, the "premium" ponzis and "luxury" status symbol type NFTs will always be on L1 - so we'll definitely see huge increases in gas prices.

Anyway, getting back to the base case, and what actual sustainable revenue looks like - as mentioned above, it has been relative constant over the years. This comes with the implication that, actually, staking rewards are going to be relatively constant - in the \~1.5%-2.5% range for priority fees + \~1% range for MEV. Meanwhile, issuance is going to reduce over time, so we can safely conclude the long-term staking rewards are going to be somewhere in the \~5% range. Coincidentally, at current staking rate, we should expect very mild deflation, but as more is staked this will revert back to mild inflation.

Now, some will argue "but there are whole new usecases that will come online". Sure, and fees will go up over time in $ times, but as 7 years of data suggests, not in ETH terms. Also, as mentioned above, there's orders of magnitude more space available on L2s going forward, who will pay relatively negligible fees to L1 post EIP-4844 as there'll be a dedicated data fee market. So why won't L1 fees collapse? Because L1 will remain the premiere execution layer - even the perfect L2 won't be quite as secure and Lindy, and the venue for high-value settlements for the foreseeable future.

Tl;dr: staking rewards are likely going to remain the \~5% APR range long term and inflation will probably tend towards being mildly positive, so when you see absurd projections based on unsustainable mania burns during the bull - remain resolute and sell your ETH to those who are aping in thinking 10%-20% yields and 2% deflation is sustainable.

My final "do it while neutral sentiment lasts" rant - I've used the phrase "markets are forward-looking" often. Based on the backlash I've received in the last few days, I sense that people misunderstand it as meaning "investors can predict the future". It's kind of the opposite - in the bull market people will price in a utopia that may be years away; likewise in a bear market people will price in the doom. We have seen this multiple times in crypto. But what we (arguably) haven't seen is a secular peak where the wider market with a majority of institutions/HNWIs will price in a mature Ethereum 5-10 years from now. It's very wrong to think ETH price is up-only until "Ethereum's vision is delivered and there is mass adoption" - markets have never worked like that, especially emerging markets. There are countless examples to look at with very few exceptions - but the most obvious and relevant one to study is, of course, the dot-com bubble. They priced in the final form of the internet way back in 2000, which took till the 2010s to actually deliver - and yes, many internet companies took 10 years to revisit their 2000 highs. Now, some will argue that Ethereum is not a company - but that doesn't matter, ETH's value is derived by market forces, and crypto markets follow the same behaviour.

<summary>Community: u/alexiskef has an ELI5 for the Ethereum KZG ceremony</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10fu4px/daily_general_discussion_january_19_2023/j4zrfmk/)

Hey friends! As you might have noticed from the many comment threads these past 2-3 days, the Ethereum Foundation has been running (since the beginning of this week and for approximately two more months) something called the [KZG Ceremony](https://ceremony.ethereum.org/). 

**MY** noob-friendly eli5 is that this super-easy-to-participate and open-to-everyone ceremony will contribute (via super-fancy-behind-the-scene math) the necessary randomness for the trust assumptions of the upcoming EIP4844, aka ProtoDanksharding.

(The official explanation is: "*This ceremony, sometimes called a "Trusted Setup", will generate a structured reference string (SRS) which is needed for the commitments to work. An SRS is secure as long as at least one participant in the ceremony successfully conceals their secret.")*

The website of the Ceremony has plenty of information on all things ceremony, however, I wanted to share with you all an üéßüî• [excellent podcast episode](https://epicenter.tv/episodes/478) üî•üéß with a conversation between Carl Beekhuizen & Trenton Van Epps from the Ethereum Foundation and the host of [Epicenter.tv](https://Epicenter.tv), Friederike Ernst.

The topics the three of them touch on, are:

* Danksharding and scaling Ethereum
* Data BLOBs and data availability
* KZG ceremony
* How trusted setups evolved
* KZG commitment requirements
* How trust is ensured
* Combining randomness
* How storing secrets is prevented
* General contribution details
* Special contributions
* Quantum vulnerability
* General EIP-4844 timeline

I certainly do not understand 99% of the math, but this conversation really helped me understand the basic ideas behind the whole process! Enjoy!

<summary>Random: u/Bob-Rossi is familiarizing themselves with Linux for the start of their staking journey</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10gp4if/daily_general_discussion_january_20_2023/j56ezbm/)

Public accountability update on my staking journey w/ u/benido2030

After an appreciated pep-talk last week, I took a few hours this week to continue to familiarize myself with Linux. Namely the terminal - found a random YouTube video to just follow along with and type through some basic commands. I think this has been helpful so far because my first attempt at all this I just jumped into a staking guide with literal zero understanding what was going on with the terminal. It was an unnecessary stressor knowing one deviation from a guide and I'm screwed.

I am hoping to get a little more familiar with Linux in general before I go further. So if anyone has ideas / videos of things that helped them when they were starting I'd love to see them. I noticed the [CoinCashew Guide](https://www.coincashew.com/coins/overview-eth/guide-or-how-to-setup-a-validator-on-eth2-mainnet/part-i-installation/guide-or-security-best-practices-for-a-eth2-validator-beaconchain-node) has a lot of security best practice type things I need to familiar myself with, so may start focusing on that stuff. 

If anyone cares (and to in general share back links myself) someone here gave me this link (sorry, it was awhile ago) --- [https://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php](https://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php) --- which was a nice starter read and this was the video I followed along with --- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3ii48qYBxA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3ii48qYBxA) --- which had a lot of similiar stuff but was easy to follow in video. Both super basic, but I can't stress enough how much of a newbie I am with Linux... so it was a comfy start. 

I'd also like to keep this quasi-weekly thing going, so if anyone else is trying going down their staking journey feel free to jump in.

<summary>Analysis: u/LogrisTheBard discusses NFT tickets</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10icjgc/daily_general_discussion_january_22_2023/j5fm373/)

I think the form of NFTs ripe for the next bull cycle will be different. Just as web2 innovated on web1 by adding interactivity, I think we‚Äôll see the same occur for the next wave of NFT‚Äôs. Gone will be the hype for profile pictures and we'll transition towards NFTs with steady demand and which produce revenue streams.

I don't think the infrastructure will be there next bull market for real world asset NFTs like car or house deeds. Governments already have systems for those and even if it would reduce their costs that isn't a metric they are optimizing for. So, I'm looking at informatic use cases of the blockchain that can remain in the digital realm to the point of delivery.

Chief among these are live events or NFT ticketing. Live events occur on a regular basis and the total addressable market cap here makes the art market blush. I particularly like this use case because it serves everyone better except the existing parasitic middlemen.

Just from a technical feature perspective, NFTs provide a provenance trail. If you gate NFT transfers to KYC'd customers then the venues which switch to this system can actually know who attended their events. This is obviously useful information which is lost now and it enables entirely new pathways to engagement between performers and attendees. For example there could be exclusive ticket sale rounds to whitelisted addresses based on previous event attendance.

Additionally there are trust and corruption issues with current ticketing approaches such as corrupt release mechanisms and opaque service charge fees. At the very least having the sale logic on the blockchain can add transparency and equal access to the process. Protocols like POAP and Funfair have already demonstrated provably fair lottery mechanisms when demand outstrips supply. Alternatively more market-like initial auction systems have been demonstrated by newer tokens like Gearbox which used [0xCider](https://gov.gearbox.fi/t/gip-31-1-gear-strategy-cider-ed-liquidity/2050/87). Blockchains are demonstrably excellent at executing a provably fair, transparent process.

As to fees, a lot of the service fee charged by Ticketmaster actually goes to [middlemen or the venue](https://thehustle.co/the-sneaky-economics-of-ticketmaster/). It's how they were able to grow to their current size: they stopped treating the attendee as the customer. There is a market opportunity here to reduce Ticketmaster's cut of the fees though. That is still substantial. Ticketmaster's revenue was [$12.3B in 2022](https://www.economicliberties.us/press-release/live-nation-ticketmasters-record-earnings-come-at-the-expense-of-fans-artists-and-venue-owners/). It's a rather perfect opportunity for some Defi mullet and we're already seeing it start to happen even from Ticketmaster themselves[[1]](https://nbatopshot.com/nba-allstar-vip-pass)[[2]](https://news.bitcoin.com/binance-to-sell-nft-tickets-for-major-italian-soccer-club-lazio/)[[3]](https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/31/ticketmaster-taps-the-flow-blockchain-to-let-event-organizers-issue-nfts-tied-to-tickets/). This is where things like Rarible's multi-chain protocol would really shine as it is fully indexed and is made to allow numerous frontends, dial their own parameters, and for people to pick whatever chain they want.

Finally, unlike a normal ticket stub or plain digital record an NFT ticket can be associated with extra metadata (even after the event). A system like Ticketmaster could add some type of history system so you can view a collection of your previous events and event highlight reels for each but they haven't in 20 years. By contrast, this is much more normal for NFTs already. Integrate this into a digital picture frame and you can have a place on superfan's wall that cycles through highlights of the favorite games they've attended or that lets them build a digital gallery in something like Decentraland and compete with other fans.

So, there's an opportunity here to improve the status quo for venues, performers, and attendees and the only one who stands to lose is a generally reviled middleman. I don't think we'll get as much push-back from the consumers here as we'll see from Gamefi. However, stuff will need to be built.

The UX for buying tickets needs to be tailored to buying tickets. Customers need to see the layout of the venue for the seats being sold, be shown the context of the event, and be offered pathways to deeper engagement with that event‚Äôs community. All of these are UI centric changes that don‚Äôt require much contract code and are ripe for innovation. Adjacent to the chain, the NFT metadata stored on IPFS could be standardized for easier integration into navigation and viewing software.

Assuming devnets run for another month, and then the two public testnets are spaced 3 weeks apart, that would put end March Shanghai. If devnets are run for two weeks and then the two public testnets each spaced two weeks apart, Shanghai date would be early March.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10jyo68/daily_general_discussion_january_24_2023/j5quguk/)

I'm a long time hodler. At the moment I have most of my ETH staked with CB. With withdrawals coming soon. I figured now is a good time to explore solo staking. Since I'm not tech savvy. I feel solo staking is a little out of my comfort zone. I looked into using dapenode and rocketpool. After looking at tons of videos and guides. I decided to try the rocketpool route. I followed this guys YouTube video. 

<https://youtu.be/-o3IV3AClw8>

I was able to follow along pretty good and now I'm officially running a node on rocketpools testnet. I'm surprised it's actually working. With that said. I feel like I'm missing so much understanding of what is really happening with my node. All I know is I followed a bunch of copy and paste code into the terminal and got it to work. Did I secure my device enough? Did I set up ssh that I have no idea how to use? Is my firewall setup? What is my computer going to do when I lose power? At this moment I'm a very dangerous eth staker. There's so much I need to learn in order to trust myself with staking real eth. I wish there was some kind of staking class I could attend. I'm going to keep learning as much as I can until withdrawals are enabled. Once that happens my eth will go back to the safety of my hardware wallet until I feel 100% comfortable staking on my own. Thanks to everyone of you that help guys/gals like myself. Cheers.

<summary>Random: u/Tricky_Troll decides now is a good time to reflect on the good, the bad and the ugly of how he played the last bull market</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/109rzd5/daily_general_discussion_january_12_2023/j40rrwq/)

**Disclaimer: This is a long-winded reflective post. Skip to the end if you would prefer a TL;DR.**

Now is the perfect time to reflect on your own personal wins and regrets from the bull market just gone. It's quiet, fundamentals are showing strong with Ethereum's strength above $1,000 and a bottom feels like it may have formed. Don't @ me if I jinxed it.

Personally, I'd give myself a 5/10. Overall I did ok.

**The Good:**

My early bull run strategy was good. I sold the last of my Bitcoin after its initial run to $30K/40K as the first part of taking profits. I splashed out on a couple of things I'd been wanting for a while and I diversified into to physical assets as well as leaving some aside for paying tax (just not quite enough in the end üôÉ). Also, losses which will be covered in "The Ugly" were kept to a responsible (enough) % of my stack and I did not double down or try to gamble back shitcoin losses. Losses were accepted and rational portfolio allocations were stuck to. Once the shitcoins went to Goblintown, my precious ETH stack was left untouched.

Finally, I managed to hit my 32 ETH target and run a solo validator node. It was a lot of learning for me but solo staking is very satisfying and worth the effort.

**The Less Good:**

I sold all of my shitcoins and was full ETH by the time the bear market kicked in to 5th gear. This allowed me to fund quitting my job temporarily to go to Hodlercon and do a long delayed trip with my family in the UK. I should have sold these earlier but I managed to shake these bags before we entered Goblintown.

**The Bad:**

I had a cash out plan and my target was not hit as I was hoping. My cash out plan evolved after an event I will cover in the next section. The bad thing is that part of my target was hit and I did nothing about it.

**The Ugly:**

35% of my stack was lost to shitcoins in 2020 and DeFi coins in 2021. Overconfidence from picking out Chainlink in the 2018 bear and then selling the top in late 2019/early 2020 contributed to this greatly. It was a humbling experience but also, unfortunately this loss of 35% of my stack was the reason why my cash out target was not hit. I had a set $ amount I wanted to sell (which would be hit at around a $4.5K ETH) or when a bunch of my favourite indicators on <https://www.LookIntoBitcoin.com> flashed sell. After losing the 35%, the cash out amount crept up since I had less ETH to sell (it went up to about a $9K ETH). Due to the elongated nature of the late bull run, less than half of the sell indicators I was following flashed sell. I tried to time the peak too close. As a result, the peak I expected never came and I never sold when I should have.

**Learnings:**

So what have I learned and what can you learn from me? My first piece of advice is never to double down to re-coup losses. After I lost my shitcoin stack I was tempted to double down and I had other coins lined up. But guess what, those coins did terribly. I would have only lost more ETH and wouldn't be solo staking today. Set aside a portion of your stack to leave invested in ETH for the long run. Do not waver from this allocation. If you find that hard, maybe staking is for you. A 16 ETH rETH minipool or 32 ETH solo node cannot be partially sold. It's a great way to keep assets locked in for your long term investment thesis, also earn a yield and of course help to decentralise Ethereum!

Secondly, I think it's important to stick to a cash out plan. Furthermore, I think laddering out is better too. It's easy to want to hit a target but this market is too unpredictable to rely on such a hit or miss strategy. Everyone is different, so I don't think this strategy suits everyone but if you are someone with a cash out plan, I'd recommend sticking to it and I'd also recommend having multiple targets over a single cash out price.

My final piece of advice is to stay humble and stay cautious. Now that I have experienced the feeling of winning a big bet on one of just 2 altcoins to go on a big run up last bear market and subsequently thinking I'm a genius and can do it again, I see this attitude everywhere. Look at Do Kwon or any of the has beens last bull run. They think they can make a comeback and are trying to build up their redemption arcs. They got lucky. Then they got overconfident and greedy. Then the market turned and their shenanigans that they thought was proof they were geniuses revealed that they really aren't any better than the rest of us. In fact, they're worse. At least I kept my losses limited and didn't keep leveraging up. Keeping my bullishness and self-confidence in check is the only reason I didn't lose it all. There were definitely points where I wanted to go all in on my shitcoins but I didn't because I knew it was irresponsible.

Anyway, I apologise for the long-winded nature of this post. I don't really have the time today to flesh it out into a nice concise ordered write up. I guess I'll leave you with a TL;DR instead.

TL;DR:

- Stay humble. Watch out for the trap of over-confidence after you make a smart investment or two thinking you can do it again. Chances are you can't.
- Keep responsible allocations. I'd have lost it all had I not resisted the urge to double down in an effort to recoup losses. Running a staking node can help with this.
- I recommend cash out plans and sticking to them. Furthermore, laddered cash out plans help protect against uncertainty. My all or nothing plan has left me frustrated and short on liquidity in this bear.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/109rzd5/daily_general_discussion_january_12_2023/j40d0kx/)

**hardware wallet is a MUST** if you have more than $2k in crypto and you are not cashing that out right now and leaving.

**Transfer your valuable NFTs from hot/burner to COLD (hardware) wallet**. While Gas is still quite cheap at night US time/morning EU time. You can bundle (x20 items) thru OS. Yes, you might end up paying like 0.01-0.02e per transfer.

Another good practice is to use revoke . cash 's application and also remove permissions from time to time.

I know to most people it's a given but I keep seeing people getting hacked here and there and I'd rather remind again. And your not garbage NFTs are valuable to! so remember that. Trust me, it might suck and feel like unnecessary investment and use of money transferring assets but you'd be happy you still have all your stuff cause for non-hardware wallets it's not IF it's WHEN you'll lose it all so act accordingly.

The following will serve as an *extremely* abbreviated version of my research into the revoke.cash browser extension, focusing as narrowly on privacy as I can.

Obviously we're taking a different direction here, as this is clearly not a wallet. However, I think its fair to say that this one is particularly relevant to my ethfinanciers.

Revoke.cash was downloaded directly from the chrome [webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/revokecash-web3-scam-prot/nmniboccheadcclilkfkonokbcoceced?hl=en)

Starting off, the extension's privacy tab on the chrome webstore page looks good. No data collection is always good to see.

<https://imgur.com/qw2xLIY>

Immediately upon installation we see this POST request to Amplitude, an analytics platform.

There are a few identifiers, including 'user_id', 'device_id', 'session_id', and 'insert_id'. Not so great.

And the keen reader may notice the fields 'initial_referrer', and 'initial_referring_domain'. The values here are 'EMPTY', but I take massive issue with this in the case that they are ever used to collect that data.

If they're going to be collecting your [referer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referer) header, the least they could do is misspell it as the HTTP spec does haha.

I will go into how the extension functions in a more extensive revision, which will include a review of some crypto scams, and a taste of malware analysis.

But this single request to Amplitude got me wondering what happens when I visit <https://revoke.cash> using my everyday use firefox installation, with only uBlock Origin and NoScript enabled.

<https://imgur.com/xtgQ1KM>

Here we see a request to hxxps://scripts.simpleanalyticscdn.com/latest.js - An obvious tracker, BOOM instantly killed by NoScript

Worth noting that I did not see a request to this domain when using the extension.

<https://imgur.com/O01Qczo>

Here we see a javascript file trying attempting to force my browser to generate POST requests to 127.0.0.1:8545

Either way, killed by NoScript.

Maybe theres some extension functionality that its trying to interact with?

<https://imgur.com/jwoL55B>

On the bottom right of the page you can see those connections are refused, even with the extension in use. Odd.

<https://imgur.com/dXONMEH>

Back to firefox, we see a request to amplitude just as generated by the extension. However, this time uBlock killed that attempt.

I keep harping on the fact that by installing extensions, you allow them to completely bypass protections such as NoScript and uBlock Origin.

Be careful out there, folks

gm gentlemen,

a quick reminder about the KZG ceremony: <https://ceremony.ethereum.org/>

You can help by contributing your randomness to the whole thing. The more people participate the better, as it only takes one honest person to make the whole thing a success.

It's really easy and fast to do. All you need is an Ethereum wallet address with more than 3 transfers, and then it's just writing some random text and signing a bunch of messages and you're already done. The whole process takes <2 minutes.

You'll get a POAP too, so get going and help secure & scale Ethereum! This will be used for the danksharding implementation later on.

> To make an analogy, your posts about security analysis, and potentially teaching us to do those kinds of investigations ourselves, play the same role in the broader ecosystem that fraud proofs do on optimistic rollups. If you start with a trusted system, and the system is honest, then all is well and good, but if they're not honest, and nobody is checking on them, then they can get away with anything. For such a system to become trustless, you need a sufficient number of capable fraud-checkers who are checking often enough such that there's a near-certainty someone would catch malfeasance if it were present. The more people capable of checking ecosystem tools to see if they're doing bad things, the more trustless the ecosystem becomes. It's really crucial

Beautifully put. To this end, I will be putting together a guide detailing exactly the steps I have been taking, along with resources, and assistance wherever needed. The vast majority of the process is non-technical, just critical thinking with an almost cynical mindset haha.

I previously announced that I will be releasing a more in-depth review of revoke.cash, where this extension will also be used as we explore a variety of interesting crypto scams.

If you're interested in learning more about infosec in a very easy to digest fashion, I would recommend checking that out when it is released.

I have also promised an analysis of [Fire](https://www.joinfire.xyz/).

No commitment to any particular order can be made, but these are all on my plate.

This is last call for requests, before I leave this up to the community to continue.

I typed out a pretty thorough response, as it‚Äôs stuff I hear a lot and also I think is shortsighted. Since the comment was 3 days ago, it‚Äôs buried to the depths of Reddit, so I wanted to draw attention to it here:

<summary>Community: u/Spacesider shares his staking experience and tips for anyone else experiencing similar issues</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10cc78w/daily_general_discussion_january_15_2023/j4frjwo/)

So a little something regarding how my staking experience is going.

Prior to the merge I was running Geth on one SSD and Lighthouse on another SSD.

My attestation performance was fairly good, consistently around 97-98%. Back then you didn't rely on the execution client for attesting, just for block proposals, so it wasn't a huge deal if it couldn't keep up.

Coming up to the merge I moved away from Geth and installed Nethermind on the same drive as Lighthouse, and on the other drive installed Teku-Besu (As a fallback pair).

Now with both a consensus client and execution client on the same SSD, and an execution being a requirement, it can't quite keep up. Attestation performance is averaging around 93-94% and I am seeing the occasional message pop up in my logs stating that the execution engine is not in sync.

I've been putting off addressing this for the longest time... But I figure better now than never!

I've ordered an NVMe that has 10x the read/write speeds and 10x the IOPS of the current SSD's I have. Hopefully in the next week I will get it and install it and move the primary pair (Lighthouse-Nethermind) across.

If anyone else has been getting poor attestation performance, this may be something to look into.

<summary>Random: u/benido2030 shares their learnings from 2022</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10d6prc/daily_general_discussion_january_16_2023/j4ktvza/)

I wrote a long post about my [learnings](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/rpgcip/daily_general_discussion_december_27_2021/hq4yyqn/) at the end of 2021. That was (in hindsight) after we had peaked and I think it's just reasonable to update that post and include my 2022 learnings.

1. **Don't invest in last cycles coins** - Still very valid, and probably even more important now that we might be on the verge of recovering and potentially starting a new cycle.
1. **Understand the narrative** - This one is tricky. I think when I wrote this in 2021 I thought by just understanding the narrative and being early you will print. True is: narratives are important, but most likely (at least for me) only really relevant in a bull market. Or the other way around: Narratives are nice in bear market, but that doesn't mean they will safe you. E.g. There was a "real yield" season and GMX did hold pretty nicely, but it's probably an exception. Other narratives didn't help me at all. This leads to:
1. **NEW: In a bear you gotta be patient (and buy ETH)** - Now this sounds crazy, but I really think this might be the biggest learning from the last 12 months. Fade narratives in bear market. Sell last cycles coins. All of them. Don't think they will recover, because even if they do, they will lose vs ETH and you can increase your holdings if you really want to double down. I kept two tokens and let me tell you I am not happy :)
Buy ETH whenever you feel like it (longterm it's most likely a good buy). But also with ETH, be patient, history maybe doesn't repeat but it rhymes. E.g. I bought the bottom at 800$, but I also made some more buys in the other crashes at e.g. 1750. Why? Because of "FOMO", being scared it could immediately pump - which it usually doesn't in a real bear market. There is capitulation in a crash and a time based capitulation. And YES! I know that I / we don't know. And maybe next cycle is different. Still I think understanding what patience means is important.
1. **NEW: Make a bear an opportunity** - This is kind of connected to the the old 6. "Take profits". I think that's still very important: having cash on the sidelines means a crash/ dip might even have a positive side, both for your portfolio but also (and maybe more important) emotionally.
But I think I would go even further: I sold most of my alts in Feb 22. I felt I was late, didn't sell the top, bla bla. In hindsight I think that move wasn't bad at all. But I could have even shorted last cycles trash. Not in a day trading way, but as in shorting and forgetting the short. I was so impressed by some people (especially the Luna short from 100$ to 0 from that one guy that covered his short for 42cents in the end). I know I can't do that, I know he's probably one in a 1000, but I also think there is a valid way that includes shorting when you feel the bear has really arrived.
1. **You can't predict crypto short term, NEW: you can predict crypto long term** - I am more convinced than ever that this is the case and I also think that doesn't really contradict anything I have said before :) But the more important part of this is: I am sure we can predict crypto long term. I'll probably write about this soon, but e.g. "execution layers" aka "L2s" are alpha. Modular blockchains are alpha. ETH as the one global settlement layer is alpha. I can't imagine that L2 tokens won't pump. I am long OP and will try to go long with other L2 tokens, either by buying or CDP.
1. **Finance is a different world** - Still valid, still learning so much, see 4.
1. **Take profits** - I didn't take many profits apart from the alts in Feb, so I sucked here. I was too bullish. I was hoping for 10k ETH, 100k BTC etc. etc. So I am planning profit taking now. I am trying to estimate valid prices to exit certain positions, e.g. by understanding what certain prices say about my tokens, I compare them to evaluations of last cycle (example: If OP reached 20$ that would mean 80B FDV which is close to SOLs mcap last cycle - and I think that's already bullish, even if it's just 10x, compared to SOLs 100x) and try to be more realistic and less emotional when it comes to taking profits. I think I was driven by greed and euphoria last cycle and will try to change this going into 2023 and 2024.

I have some goals for the next 24-36 months and hope that reflecting on my learnings will help me to make stuff happen. Will it be as easy as I think? Def not (but I also don't think it is as easy as it might sound here!). But I want to grow, improve, challenge myself, so we need goals to measure success :)

The Brasky's Strike Back Part II

It's been over 2 months since my wife lost her job and wanted to share an update. We had both found job opportunities on separate coasts of the US and we're prepared to live apart for a few months so that we could find the income to keep the house and wait for something permanent to open up back home. I had even readied the house and advertised it for rental hoping to find a tenant while we were gone.

At the last minute we both found jobs in town...not only did she get hired with full time employment but she'll be making 20% more than her previous job!!! I had been watching our little one as my main trade is in construction and the real money is made on large industrial projects but requires traveling away from home. I had found a part time gig that worked well with our schedules but had to quit as I was going back on the road to work. I got a call right before leaving and a side hustle that I had tried to get started back in August has now just opened up...and I'll be making more than double my previous income while still playing daddy day-care!!!

The last few months have definitely been a trial and has put a lot of stress on our marriage but we came out as better spouses and better positioned than before!! We had enough savings in case of emergencies and I was prepared to start selling my sweet sweet precious ETH if things got worse. We were able to not burn through everything and our ETH stack is still intact earning rewards!! Glad I can share this my ETH fam and anyone else going through the fire. Amazed to have a spouse who can get aggressive and when the bear bites we bite back.

<summary>OPSEC: u/magnushansson shares a new paper on crypto network security</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/103r9ly/daily_general_discussion_january_5_2023/j31az1r/)

Economist Eric Budish [presents a new paper (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYFRQGwe7rI&ab_channel=EconomicsDepartment%2COxfordUniversity) showing skepticism regarding the cost of securing the Bitcoin network. The main criticism boils down to the fact that there is no trust in the system (trustless), in the sense that there is no "memory" to build up trust. A miner is only trusted by spending computing resources right now, but does not get rewarded for building up a good reputation. He argues that although this is a perfectly fine model for security, it get's very expensive. In the concluding remarks, Budish briefly discusses PoS and says that it could potentially be used in a better way.

I think his arguments for the cost of securing the Bitcoin network is interesting and probably valid (depending on what the attack looks like). People in crypto should not be arrogant and dismiss criticism, but instead try to understand all perspectives to be able to build better systems. I'm not sure how trust in a decentralized system would look, or even if it's a good idea (Any Layer0 player comments?). Also, PoS certainly have clear advantages: E.g., the cost of an attack is significantly larger, as the attacker risks losing the capital (not the case with mining). But if the capital required to secure the network needs to be way higher than the transactional value of the network, that could be an obstacle for growth. Are there any attempts to clearly work out the economics for PoS?

Edit:

Thanks for the comments and suggestions to listen to Justin Drake on this, will take a look!

I also found this quite intense twitter discussion on the subject: <https://twitter.com/alexoimas/status/1525505965029830656?s=20&t=X2P3CnyeNNKtinMsJCP9Ww>

And this blog post: <https://hugonguyen.medium.com/a-review-of-budishs-51-attack-theories-what-is-the-fair-price-of-an-old-asic-59a7dcf9ff94> which argues that the scenarios in Budish article are unrealistic. The author also argues PoW > PoS.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/104mg1j/daily_general_discussion_january_6_2023/j39muiw/)

For the first time in my 6 years of crypto I am starting to seriously ponder: I do not actually get the 'point' of bitcoin. It's unprofitable to mine it. It pays no yield if you already have it. It doesn't protect you from inflation. It needs a steady supply of greater fools during its cycle because its security costs scale with price (see: boom-bust curve). Its vocal supporters are cringe. I've always agreed that bitcoin is pristine collateral while ETH has a place as a programmable crypto asset but things have changed. I'm at the point where the flippening is not a meme anymore - it is the guaranteed outcome of the supply/demand dynamics that we are witnessing now - just needs more time to play out. ETH is now the pristine collateral imo, and I don't see why in the future ETH can't have flipped Bitcoin multiple times.

<summary>Ecosystem: u/austonst enlightens us to the conflict of interest for entities running MEV block builder and MEV relays</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/105hh6b/daily_general_discussion_january_7_2023/j3cqss0/)

MEV-Boost relay transaction censorship has gotten a good amount of attention since the Merge, and for good reason. Fortunately, word has gotten around and the trend is improving.

So I think it's time to emphasize another problem in the relay space: relays who also run builders. Relay-builders as opposed to independent relays? I need a better term for this. This is informed by my time working on the [Aestus relay](https://aestus.live/), and while I believe our relay can help with this problem, I hope you can trust that my goal here is not marketing. We don't make any money off this relay anyway.

In a world without relays, proposers and builders would have to trust each other directly: depending on the implementation one would always be able to steal MEV from the other. Relays sit in the middle and take on all that trust. As long as the relay is trusted, proposers and builders each enter a trustless relationship with the other.

However, a malicious relay, working with one side or the other, can execute all the attacks they were supposed to prevent. A relay working with a builder can steal MEV from a proposer or the other builders, and likewise, a relay working with a proposer can steal MEV from a builder.

Now let's bring relay-builders into this. An entity that is running both a relay and a builder has a clear conflict of interest. Compromising the relay's neutrality by working together with their builder could immensely improve profitability. Let's list out some potential attacks that relay-builders could carry out. These are in roughly increasing order of subtlety and with names I'm making up on the spot, with "you" being the relay-builder:

1. **Single-Block Copying:** Some third party builder has submitted a block to the relay that is more valuable than the block your builder made. Simply copy all the transactions from the third-party builder's block, but make it so you keep any value that is not sent to the proposer. Send a bid to the proposer with your block instead of the other builder's. A competent builder should be able to detect this and trash your reputation.

1. **Ignoring Other Builders:** A third-party builder submitted a block more valuable than your builder's block. You should pass on the third-party bid to the proposer. Instead, pretend you didn't see it. Submit your builder's bid instead. Done naively like this, the third-party builder should be able to catch it.

1. **Multi-Block Copying:** Multiple builders have submitted blocks with valuable MEV. Build your block from the most valuable transactions from each of them. Make sure your bid to the proposer will legitimately win the auction, but keep the rest of the MEV for yourself. I don't know if builders would detect this, might take some analysis and time.

1. **Obfuscated MEV Copying:** Same as with the first two copying attacks, but with intent to be subtle about it. For example, if a third-party builder/searcher has a truly novel source of MEV extraction that only they know how to do, they'd recognize if it were stolen, so only copy MEV that can be identified as a recognizable strategy and is unlikely to come from a private mempool. Implement some fuzzing, make your copied MEV transactions slightly different so as to give plausible deniability that maybe your builder found that MEV on their own. Might be hard to detect.

1. **Auction Manipulation:** Anyone can check the best current bid through the relay API, which is a problem in itself, but the relay has particularly low-latency access to this info. In case a third-party builder only very slightly outbids your builder, quickly create a new block with a winning bid and propose that instead. The relay has some wiggle room with timing to make sure your builder can always outbid. Catching this would require long-term analysis and may be covered by plausible deniability or obfuscation.

1. **Block Timing Manipulation:** A third-party builder submitted a block more valuable than the one made by your builder. Give your block priority in the relay's block validation system, or better yet, don't waste time validating it at all (you made it, you trust it). Make your competitor's block low-priority for validation or otherwise stall it so it's less likely to be ready when the proposer asks for the best bid. Hard to detect, covered by plausible deniability, and current data APIs don't expose enough timing information to help with detection or can be manipulated. This could be an actual concern.

1. **Builder Colocation:** Most builders will make \~1 submission per second, with value increasing over time as more bundles and tx's arrive. Builders that are geographically closer to the relay, with lower latency, will tend to have slightly higher-value blocks because of it. If a relay and builder are running in the same data center, under the same account/project, on a high-speed private LAN, that will give them a competitive edge. This maybe doesn't quite qualify as an attack, but a neutrality concern at least.

I want to be clear that **I have no reason to believe existing relay-builders are malicious and carrying out these attacks**. But why accept the possibility that they may some day occur? Why connect to relays that require extra trust assumptions when there are alternatives?

Right now, Ultrasound and Agnostic are the only relays not operating their own builders. Aestus is temporarily running a builder, but it doesn't extract MEV, doesn't take any profit, and only operates until we get a reliable set of third-party builders connected (otherwise we might not have any blocks for connected proposers). I would encourage everyone to direct their validators and builders to those relays and to ask existing relay-builders to consider only running one or the other. I'm grateful to the early relay-builders for getting us off the ground, but now we can start to hold the space to a higher standard.

<summary>Ecosystem: u/superphiz has some predictions for the Shanghai upgrade</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/105hh6b/daily_general_discussion_january_7_2023/j3c2ahu/)

I'm going to make some guesses for what might happen on the beacon chain regarding withdrawals. I want to qualify these as "guesses", because reality rarely unfolds as we expect and it would overestimate my foresight to call them predictions. Also, since I'm not making predictions, I acknowledge that it's difficult to quantify the results of many of these guesses.

- Shanghai is likely to happen some time around Tuesday, March 28, 2023. This isn't based on any factual information and I'm VERY behind on core dev calls, but I do think that developers want to push this in March, and Tuesdays are a good day to do these. Guess confidence: 4%.
- Network usage will skyrocket immediately after the merge as people race to take advantage of whatever strategy they've developed to respond to withdrawals. Some folks will be racing to claim stolen beacon chain funds, while others will be racing to save their funds from an attacker. Other people will have novel strategies that I can't conceive. This will lead to high execution rewards for validators who propose those blocks. Guess confidence: 20%.
- MEV block rewards will be very high for several hours based on the previous point. Guess confidence: 15%
- There will be few "real" validator exits, but there will be validator shuffling that will appear as exits and spook some people. For example, providers who have merged or folded will want to re-secure their keys under new management and will exit to re-stake under improved security, but this won't be clear to observers who will only perceive it as "churn". Guess confidence: 30%.
- The price is likely to fluctuate 2% either way, but will quickly reach homeostasis because people are already committed to their positions. There will be sellers who have been eager to claim gains after having locked coins, and buyers who are comforted by the knowledge that withdrawals are real and sustainable. Guess confidence: 0%
- Over the next year, individual deposits to the beacon chain will climb steadily as observers who couldn't commit to an unknown timeline now accept that the beacon chain is stable. I'm expecting 20 million staked Ether aka 625,000 validators by the end of 2023. Guess confidence: 5%
- Large institutions will finally be comfortable depositing their treasuries into the beacon chain and taking staking rewards. This will occur over a 1-3 year period and result in significant locked coins. It remains to be seen whether they'll take a profit maximalist or chain maximalist approach to staking, but based on our educational efforts it's realistic to assume that many of these institutions will recognize the value of decentralization, trustlessness, and chain health when staking. Guess confidence: 10%
- We'll see a new wave of LSD products, with products who support chain health leading the charge, and products who who maximize greed seeing less usage. In simple terms: institutions know that parasitic engagement with the beacon chain will reduce the long term viability of their investment. Guess confidence: 20%
- Public goods like schools/universities, and local governments will slowly begin dipping their toes into staking, especially in cooperatives arranged around DVT solutions that help them dilute the risk of running validators. We ought to promote these cooperatives rather than encouraging centralized approaches. Guess confidence: 2%
- We'll discover that some people and entities have lost staking keys. In the true fashion of cryptocurrency, I expect these keys to miraculously turn up in someone's private possession after many years. Guess confidence: 5%

**BONUS**: What our community can do to support this transition:

- Educate everyone you can about the transition to Proof of Stake. Many people are still unaware that this has happened.
- Talk to people about the relationship between "good staking" on a healthy network and the price. People who think they're staking selfishly will harm themselves by reducing decentralization. Staking in decentralized ways will have a positive impact on the price.
- Help people recognize that withdrawals are a fruition of the promise by core developers to prioritize withdrawals after the merge. They deserve plenty of credit for being consistent and predictable.
- Don't let people get complacent. So many people promised to move to solo home staking, or even just a better staking solution when withdrawals were enabled, but there's a natural tendency to get lazy and complacent when the opportunity is real - don't let people be lazy!
- Keep learning and building. The price is a lagging indicator of what the developers and community bring to Ethereum. You don't improve the quality of your asset by simply watching the price.

<summary>OPSEC: u/Maleficent_Plankton reminds us about a recent scam that has been going around</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/106bh8s/daily_general_discussion_january_8_2023/j3h7bg5)

There was a fairly-notable phishing post on r/CC yesterday where the user mistakenly sent tokens to an address that looked very similar to his actual address (same starting and ending characters). He originally thought he had clipboard malware that changed his address, but it turned out he actually copied to the wrong address.

If you look at his PolygonScan history days before the mistakenly transaction, you can see that he was targeted multiple times.

All these similar-looking address had interacted with his account in the past 2 weeks:

- 0xDD1B7Ce698d0d58Cd521A9c186e6a95CF043614C (his)
- 0xDd12B7E4B8e74745986DD80DDAd191D2a4d7a14C

**This is known as [address poisoning](https://mirror.xyz/x-explore.eth/cL3d_CyNujXq8XY7ueP4omNXx_IY1EG5Dz0FD0vJ90M)**. Attackers send low-value token transactions and receive 0-value token transactions to-and-from your addresses, hoping that you accidentally pick their address in future transactions.

Blockchain explorers and and some wallets will show these transactions. The recommended way to avoid getting tricked is to use an address book of whitelisted addresses. Most wallets and exchanges have an address book feature.

<summary>Random: u/MinimalGravitas discusses goats and staking?!</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/10827ir/daily_general_discussion_january_10_2023/j3qgc9r/)

GM EthFam,

So I've been thinking about whether LSDs represent almost a multipolar trap.

A multipolar trap is a situation where participants are incentivized to act in a way detrimental the good of the group, and to themselves in the long run. The most obvious example is the tradgedy of the commons. We each share a piece of land, it can support each of us grazing 10 goats. If I graze 11 goats the quality of the land might deteriorate, but so slowly it won't matter, whereas I get 10% more goat, it's an obvious choice. Unfortunately you all make the same obvious choice and so the field is overgrazed and after a few years becomes barren and most of everyone's goats starve. If you decide to be the better person and keep to the original limit of 10 goats, then all you're doing is disadvantaging yourself relative to the rest of us 11 goat havers. We can all afford more turnips than you due to goat inflation and so you end up out competed.

Getting back to ether staking... by using a centralized service rather than solo staking you get access to an LSD. This gives you advantages in terms of opportunity access, you can swap into something else if you want to or create leveraged positions or whatever.

Like with the shared field, the disadvantage is on a community level. The decentralization and 'legitimacy' of Ethereum the network, and by extention, ether the asset is compromized, meaning it is less likely to be as highly valued in the future. Sure, you could take the high ground and not use a centralized service, but then are you disadvantaging yourself with lost opportunity cost. And if you do, and most people chose a centralized service then you still lose out from the loss of perceived legitimacy anyway...

...

Except that entire scenario is not analogous to Ethereum staking today due to another option, that hopefully most of you have been hearing repeat in your heads the entire time you've been reading. Rocketpool solves the lose-lose coordination failure, by providing an option that gives people the ability to access an LSD without compromising the decentralization of the whole. With it the multipolar trap is easily disarmed, the field doesn't need to be depleated for individuals to gain the advantages.

RocketPool is the G.O.A.T.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/108x76j/comment/j3vgs6i/)

Don‚Äôt underestimate the decentralizing impact Shanghai will have. Lots of people fully aligned with Ethereum‚Äôs defining values like me have ETH staked with cexs where we would rather not, for various reasons, who will be empowered by withdrawals to revisit their position and consider going solo.

I‚Äôve run validators on testnet but don‚Äôt have the skills/confidence to do it with real money right now, but Shanghai marks a big psychological target for me to remedy that and it‚Äôs very easy to be inspired by people in this sub, describing how rocketpool, dappnode etc. are very easy to do. Plus ethstaker and all the guides. It‚Äôs taking on a huge financial responsibility but it‚Äôs about integrity and aligning one‚Äôs actions with one‚Äôs values and you see that across the Ethereum community and it is inspiring.

It might take 6 months but I‚Äôm really looking forward to watching the transition of ETH from centralized stakers to clean green homegrown (fanless, I recently learned here, so no noise and no fiddly dust hoovering!) validators.

I named my testnet validator raspberry pi ‚ÄòGoldfish‚Äô because I often couldn‚Äôt leave it alone more than a day without it dying. Even put a little goldfish sticker on it. I‚Äôm looking forward to carrying that bs over onto a nuc; name suggestions welcome.

<https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/108x76j/comment/j3vp7io/>

This brings back memories. I was so systems illiterate that it took me about a week to set up my rig before even syncing the block chains. Almost every step in the guides I had to Google something or pester the kind people in the ethstaker discord. I‚Äôd never used Linux before. Had to actually Google where to find the command prompt in Ubuntu as if ‚ÄòTerminal‚Äô wasn‚Äôt obvious enough. Didn‚Äôt know what port forwarding was. Many such examples. Once I finally felt like I knew what I was doing, I wiped the entire system and started again from scratch. Then did that a couple more times. Each time getting quicker and more confident. I think by the 3rd try I had got it down to 30 minutes before syncing the blockchains. I ended up validating on testnet for only 1 day, then swapped over to mainnet. I specifically remember phiz telling me to practice on testnet longer but beacon chain launch was imminent. I hesitated due to no withdrawal mechanism but decided there was no way I was missing genesis lol. It‚Äôs been more than 2 years since then, my rig diligently staking 24/7 without any major problems. In a weird way it‚Äôs been one of the only constants in my life, as life‚Äôs events pass by.

Tldr; I agree Shanghai will likely increase decentralisation. if I can do it, literally anyone can, and will. A focus after Shanghai should be towards making the process easier to ensure it.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/zyspvz/daily_general_discussion_december_30_2022/j27v88q/)

I have a few Rocketpool validators that are currently pending. They should be active in 3 hours. After I write this comment, I'm going to bed. I'm not very active in this sub but I lurk like a mf. I'm feeling inspired to talk about my journey from an ETH Holder to an ETH Staker.

1. First I just want to say that it hasn't been much of a journey. Staking your ETH is not hard. I ran a 8 GPU mining rig for a couple years and the process to set up a validator through Rocketpool is a fraction of the difficulty of setting up a mining rig. Shoutout to the Rocketpool team for the easy to follow documentation.
1. Secondly, along the way, I realized that Rocketpool utilizes almost every novel financial tool that has gained traction in the world of Crypto. Through the process of setting up a Rocketpool node and validators I have interacted with Automatic Market Makers, Liquidity Pools, Flash Loans, and a DAO. I have used all of these novel financial tools to create a stream of passive income. The only thing missing was an NFT. Although I wouldn't really say that I was really missing it Bob.
1. I'll sleep well tonight knowing that when I wake up tomorrow I'll be a wealthier person.

That last statement will remain true until either Ethereum fails or I fail to uphold my responsibilities as a ETH Staker.

ICYMI: The target milestone for 2023 is to ship EIP-4844, aka Proto-Danksharding. If you want to make a difference in the Ethereum ecosystem and you're looking for a way to get involved, learn about EIP-4844 and educate others. While education feels low-value to many people, bringing more eyes to a project like this brings new developers and more momentum. Don't underestimate your own ability to make a difference on the network. I know that withdrawals in 2023 will get a lot of attention, and we know it's in the pipeline, but 4844 is the giant target.

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/100d6c2/daily_general_discussion_january_1_2023/j2hswf0/)

My new year's resolution is to focus more on learning ethereum rather than focusing on price.

Lessons learnt in 2022:

1. I lost way too much Eth trying to trade during this bearmarket. Lesson: avoid short term trading. Not worth the time and mental stress.
1. I tried being a degen in 2022 by buying DOGE, trending NFTs, small cap coins and lost more money. Lesson: Be a reasonable investor and accumulate ETH and other high quality assets at undervalued prices.
1. My focus on prices has limited my learning. Lesson: Bear markets are for building and learning.

Goals:

1. Learn about Ethereum and its core upgrades
1. Learn programming - initially python +/- other web2 languages, which should all hopefully give me a good foundation for solidity / ethereum development

Accumulate more ETH

<summary>Analysis: u/RooftopPortaPotty continues their weekly investigation ofnew crypto CHROME extensions</summary>
[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/100d6c2/daily_general_discussion_january_1_2023/j2jdzfl/)

This is the second installment of my series of posts regarding the privacy of various Chrome browser crypto wallet extensions.

First entry can be found here, where we analyzed Rabby.

My approach:

This analysis has shown that my previous approach of broadly categorizing findings under 'the ok, the bad, the ugly, and the weird' is insufficient, subjective, and does not properly represent what I wish to convey.

Using Kali Linux, I downloaded Google Chrome directly from google.com/chrome.

Analysis of encrypted traffic was completed using BurpSuite + the provided root cert, installed in chrome's local cert repo. Chrome is then launched with a proxy set to Burp's listening port.

I will not be doing any sort of transactions whatsoever. I will, however, connect the wallet to a dapp.

On this New Years Day we will be taking a look at Tally Ho!

The Tally Ho extension was downloaded from <https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tally-ho/eajafomhmkipbjmfmhebemolkcicgfmd>

I must start off by giving Tally Ho credit for something that Rabby did not implement. As I went through using the wallet to create a new address, I paid no attention to the seed phrase.

<https://imgur.com/bqsyl6E>

I was hit with a quiz that ensures that the user knows their seed phrase. I reinstalled Tally Ho, created a new address, and passed the quiz this time.

An excellent general security practice that every wallet should implement.

<https://imgur.com/zbJmXcs>

Upon installation, the first request Tally Ho generates is to api.coingecko.com in search of current token prices. Notice crab season in full effect.

<https://imgur.com/seC9btg>

Here we see a request for Arbitrum's token list.

This is a 'web3' wallet, and as such we see many requests destined for chains and defi services that us ethfinanciers wont (admit to, at least) be using much.

An example of such a request, one which is quite demonstrative of the rest, looks like https://imgur.com/AEjA8m1

I dont have a problem with this activity, but it would be great to have a more Ethereum-centric version of this wallet.

<https://imgur.com/VTx7WAJ>

api.blocknative.com is used to fetch Ethereum gas fees and block info.

<https://imgur.com/T3nHyI2>

Tally Ho reaches out to Compound Finance's Github repo 'token-list' for a list of, you guessed it, tokens.

For a benign example of why this is not such a great practice, check out this request to Trader Joe's 'token-list' repo.

<https://imgur.com/LXpv2j4>

The response is a 404. Not a huge problem, just a bit sloppy seeming. Could be bad news if an attacker is able to gain access to that repo, which is likely much less heavily protected than Trader Joe's other assets.

Here is where things get a bit more subjective.

<https://imgur.com/GAT5Bp8>

We see Ankr's API being used to get the ETH balance of my new Ethereum address, notice the value '0x0' in the response.

And for the Alchemy haters, Ive got some bad news:

<https://imgur.com/bsztI6Q>

Alchemy's API is used to fetch my address' balances of various tokens, which are specified by contract address in the POST request body.

You may notice requests to mainnet.infura.io in the above image. No need to worry, these requests were generated strictly by connecting to staking.synthetix.io.

One thing that left me a bit puzzled is this request to resolve.unstoppabledomains.com

<https://imgur.com/0C3NyGb>

My wallet address is sent as a GET parameter. Along with an 'Authorization:' HTTP header.

I have not had much time to look into this service, and would love to know more if anyone has any insight.

Refreshingly, no requests to telemetry services or advertisers were found.

I call upon the great /u/REALJohnBMacLemore. Would you please be willing to do the dirty deed, ser?

Happy New Year, yall!

[View on Reddit ‚Üí](https://reddit.com/r/ethfinance/comments/1014ypw/daily_general_discussion_january_2_2023/j2osvx6/)

I continue to be amazed by the transparency of Defi sometimes. Just [look](https://llamapay.io/streams?chainId=1&address=ychad.eth) at the Yearn.finance employee expenses here. Continuously streamed, withdrawn whenever the payee wants. Compare this to your traditional corporate payroll system.

1. Why should I need a payroll advance service to draw money I'm already due for hours worked? An entire predatory industry should mostly not exist or at least should be replaced by something like Alchemix. I see no reason something like this couldn't be integrated into a time card system in an automated way for hourly employees too.
1. You know that whole labor board that people go to when their employer did something fucky with their wages? This makes it obvious instantly when the employer is behind on paying wages. The labor board could just monitor registered company addresses and automatically begin a process if a registered account is behind before the employees even notice to report something.
1. Why do you need a W2 when you have something like this? This is an IRS dream come true. Imagine all the management software like AGP you could save businesses.

But you know... people say crypto has no value.

The email in that post feels funny to me. The words seem exceptionally well chosen to provide the most warning with the least possible legal consequences. I suggest you heed their warning. If you custody with someone else, be sure they are not using Wyre to custody their assets. IMO, that is who Juno is attempting to warn you about.

Heya fam, I need some help collecting more scam examples that are different to those I already have. If anyone has examples, I'd appreciate a DM with it, a reply to this post with an imgur link or something or a discord DM at dreth#1988 if you have any good examples I haven't listed.

As of right now I have:

- Airdrop scams
- Fake exchange scams
- Excel malware
- Notification that you 'won a prize'
- An offer to use a referral code for 'mutual benefit'
- Someone offering to 10x your investment in 48 hours
- Notification of being whitelisted to participate on a presale
- Invitation to pump and dump discord groups
- Someone asking for help to exchange a token for another in a p2p exchange (despite the token being listen on uniswap with plenty of liquidity)
- A story of a scam crypto startup
- A fake USDC contract migration with instructions to basically get scammed signing some transactions
- The recent fake Chainlink scammer on reddit that DMd some users
- The NVO ICO scam and other ICO scams
- Fake token staking site scams
- Fake token listings on uniswap
- Twitter bots tagging me on fake airdrop claim sites
- Several email scams telling me money has been moved out of my wallet, that I've been hacked and all sorts of shit.

There's one notorious scam I know I'm missing and that's fake support people, so I'd appreciate at least one example of that, not more than one is needed.

If there's any meaningfully different or interesting scams you have examples of, please send them my way. I'd also apprecaite malware or anything that could be misleading to users or put them at risk. Do not post malicious links as a reply to this comment, just DM them to me.

I'm on the EVMavericks discord and moderate the StakeWise discord, verify my username well if you want to DM me on discord, don't get scammed.

A million thanks to everyone that have helped me out !

have a great day my fellow "eth maxis".

bear markets are great for buidlers.

while looking for web3/blockchain related jobs, I began working on my own blockchain project :
I'm building (from scratch front-end/back-end, the whole 9 yards) an LSD niche focused DeX liquidity aggregator.

way down the road, I'm thinking about adding features like evolving the project into a platform that will make it easier for users to participate into liquidity pools, create and run rocketpool minipool, create finance-focused NFTs using oracles and open order books.

even if the project is a total failure and absolutely no one uses it, I'm still happy to be full hand on on it building everything from UI/frontend to the backend and integration APIs of Uniswap/0x and interacting with Rocketpool/uniswap and building smart contracts.

as a software engineer, it's an experience that is like a breeze of fresh air to do a fun side passion project that may or may not transform into a "real" product.

worst case scenario, no one uses it but it gives me legitemacy when talking about my experience in the web3 with recruiters.

best case scenario, users love it and it becomes my full time job.

"average" scenario, it has some kind of traction, and keep being a fun passion project I will maintain while working full time job somewhere else.

anyway, thank you for reading my post, have a great day and may the force be with you
